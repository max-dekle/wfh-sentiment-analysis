But one big question it generated is here to stay: should we ever go back to the office? Its a question I have been asking myself for 18 years. My technology consulting company went fully virtual in 2005. Prior to that we - I ran the business with my father - had an office in a suburban neighborhood of Philadelphia. When my father passed away I started to spend more time in the office and I realized something: the office wasnt so great. Related: Unlimited holiday time for workers is good for business - even small ones | Gene Marks Clients preferred to meet about their projects in their offices, where they could bring together more of their team, so our employees were either at clients offices or working from home (yes, people did that in 2005). Other than a coffee maker and a cat, not a lot was going on. I shut the offices down and we became a fully virtual company. A very, very dysfunctional company. Sure, our overhead became much lower thanks to not paying rent or all the costs of maintaining an office but - initially - it was a pain. Those were the days of dial-up connections, ISDN lines and broadband. No Salesforce, Teams, Zoom, Slack, Gmail. Our companys accounting and other databases were kept on a server in the basement of my house, precariously close to that same cats litter box. All of that has improved of course. And the ease of virtual working means its here to stay. Gallup expects fully remote work arrangements to nearly triple compared with 2019 figures. But running a fully virtual business still isnt any better today than it was in 2005 and - long term - I can tell you it has issues. And then some. First, closing the office should have cut my overhead. It has and it hasnt. I no longer have to pay rent and utilities, nor do I have to maintain a coffee machine and pay a cleaning service or all the other expenses required to maintain an office. Instead Im forking out endless, ever-increasing subscription fees for countless cloud-based applications, tools, services and platforms and for security software. Then there are the ever-evolving list of tax issues. What forms should that remote employee or contractor be filing to be in compliance with all the local rules? What are my responsibilities? What are my liabilities? These are headaches I never had in 2005. I have workers who Ive never personally met face to face. There are additional employment costs, too. Im reimbursing my employees more for their travel as their need for human contact has increased and for the costs of their own home offices, for which I have assumed responsibility. Im paying extra if theyre located in higher tax locales. Im paying more for their paid time off and expanded flexibility which comes hand in hand with a virtual organization. I may be paying more for their lack of productivity but I have no way of knowing this. All of those are the direct costs of running a virtual company. But theres something - though indirect - that amounts to a much bigger cost: my companys culture. My team never - never - sees each other, except rarely at clients offices. Thats strange. I have workers who Ive never personally met face to face. Ive met other employees at clients and had to do a double-take to make sure it was really who I thought it was. In the past Ive tried to have holiday parties but the gathering of strangers who shared a slim employment connection was just too awkward to bear and so I discontinued those. Related: Its business as usual as in person conferences catch up to pre-Covid levels Theres no collaboration, no innovation, no fun, no personality, no dramas, no shared opinions of The White Lotus. Everyones off on their own little islands. We dont exchange client stories or ideas or problems or issues and solutions on projects which, if pooled together, would certainly benefit everyone. I sometimes have trouble hiring people, particularly younger people who - despite what some studies may say - want to be in an office, at least some of the time, so that they can be mentored, guided and helped to adjust to their new life. We have no onboarding or off-boarding rules. I have trouble evaluating people, other than relying on client feedback and my accounting manager emailing me when theres a collection issue due to bad service. We are a small, interconnected collection of strangers who happen to be working on the same clients. You could tell me that all of these problems are fixable. I could make it a point to hold more face-to-face meetings, social events and team-building activities in restaurants, hotels, event spaces or public parks. We could throw axes together, join a volleyball league, go on a company retreat, barbecue burgers but ... nah, Im too lazy for that. And besides, most of my employees - surprisingly, you might say - have been with my company for enough years that Im pretty sure they would resist. Given that turnover has been pretty low, Id say theyre happy with this arrangement. Maybe things would be better if I opened an office. Ill never know. Sure, running a fully virtual company can save money and apparently its what people want. But it can also be very, very dysfunctional. Thats been my experience. So now you know.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2023\/feb\/14\/the-secret-of-happy-home-working-a-good-local-pub","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2023\/feb\/14\/the-secret-of-happy-home-working-a-good-local-pub","DATE":"2023-02-14 17:06:38","PLAIN_TEXT":"Re Emma Beddingtons article (Is commuting good for you?

Officials urged people to use public transport rather than private cars for commuting, and said the authorities would seek to reduce sources of pollution such as outdoor burning and construction activities. Face masks would be distributed to vulnerable people, Bangkok authorities said. The Bangkok governor, Chadchart Sittipunt, said pollution was expected to rise on Thursday but it did not require schools to be closed. I would like to ask people to be prepared by checking the pollution level before planning a trip. The BMA [Bangkok Metropolitan Administration] and pollution department will control the sources of the dust and ask for cooperation from activities that generates dust such as construction sites or truck transportation, he said. Related: Air pollution linked to almost a million stillbirths a year If the situation worsened, he added, limitations on transport would be considered. Agricultural burning and forest fires are a major cause of air pollution in Thailand between December and April, especially in the north-west. Pollution from these fires also affects Bangkok, which already struggles with bad air due to its factories, construction and traffic. On Thursday morning, PM2.5 levels reached 63.2ugm3 (micrograms per cubic metre), according to the Swiss air quality company IQAir - far higher than the WHO annual air quality guideline of 5ugm3. Areas of Samut Songkhram, south-west of Bangkok, and Lampang, in the north, ranked worst in Thailand. Dr Opas Karnkawinpong, the permanent secretary in the health ministry, said this week that all provincial public health services would monitor the situation and that emergency centres would be opened in provinces experiencing high levels of pollution for more than three consecutive days.

Chadchart said the situation would be monitored closely throughout February and was expected to be better in March.

The ritual has become sacred to the rhythm of her day in Venice, where the French communications specialist has lived since October as part of a project aimed at attracting remote workers to help repopulate the lagoon city. I was just working on social media for one of my clients. They dont see the difference if Im here or in Paris, said Ebrard, 38. I love this bar during the day as you get the sun on the terrace. Its impossible to say its ugly in Venice, even when its raining. In a trend that is showing little sign of abating, the population on Venices main island dipped below 50,000 for the first time last summer. Myriad issues have driven more than 120,000 away since the 1950s, although the overriding reason has been the citys heavy focus on mass tourism, with thousands of visitors crowding its squares, bridges and narrow walkways each day. Keen to help reverse the decline, a team at Venices Ca Foscari University and the Fondazione di Venezia, a cultural heritage group, created Venywhere, a project aimed at enticing those who can work from anywhere to move to the city. Mylene Ebrard says she likes to soak up the art and culture. Photograph: Angela GiuffridaThe Observer There has been a strong population decline, but the other aspect is the age of those left - there is a big gap in the 25 to 35-year-old demographic, said Massimo Warglien, a professor at Ca Foscari. The objective is to attract new, qualified citizens to help change the demographic dynamic and skills of the city while at the same time imagining Venice as a laboratory to explore new ways of working. Ebrard didnt need much persuading. Browsing her phone last June, she came across a story about the initiative in a French newspaper. Dealing with a break-up with her husband and sensing the time away could be beneficial, she swiftly applied. My grandmother was Italian and it was my dream to move to Italy, she said. I started to learn Italian during the coronavirus pandemic and then thought I have nothing and nobody stopping me, so why not? The application process is hardly onerous: you simply need to prove you can work remotely and be willing to live in Venice for at least three months. In return for a small one-off fee, the project team provides services such as assistance with finding an apartment and dealing with visa requirements as well as organising events to help the newcomers integrate. The scheme attracted hundreds of applicants and since it began last March, it has welcomed dozens of digital nomads, including a group of 16 employees from the technology company Cisco, which is collaborating with Venywhere in its study of hybrid working. Ebrard is among the 35 from all over the world currently living in Venice and will be there until June. She rents an apartment with a view over the Giudecca canal and has made friends with her Venetian neighbours. I feel safe here, I can walk everywhere, I can soak up the art and culture, and the people have been very kind, Ebrard said. I have more time for people, more time for me and more time to figure out what I want in the future. It is as if life has sprinkled some magic on me. Alan Bruton, an American professor of architecture, has been teaching online since moving to the city in the autumn and has had such a good experience that he decided to stay and focus full-time on his new venture: designing a board game inspired by Venice. I aim to produce and become a productive member of the city, said the 59-year-old, who has an Irish passport that enables him to stay in Europe. Its the perfect place for me to be located. Jonathan Wehlte, a software engineer from Germany, has also decided to stay longer-term. Venice is very different from any other city I have lived in, said Wehlte, 35. There are no cars, you can walk everywhere... and there is so much beauty it inspires you to get out of your habitual thoughts. You start to get new ideas, and think about how society could be in the future. Venice has experienced other mass exoduses over its history, such as after the fall of its powerful maritime republic which impoverished the city economically. Tourists crowd the Rialto Bridge - a downside for digital nomads. Photograph: Jumping RocksUniversal Images GroupGetty Images Before the fall of the Republic in 1797 the population was around 150,000 and in 1838 it was almost 40% less, said Warglien. It took decades to get back to the original population size and most of the recovery was due to a positive migratory balance. Venice has been creative in attracting new inhabitants in the past, he added. During the Republic there were two levels of citizenship - for Venetians and non-Venetians, who were typically merchants. We need to think about different forms of citizenship. Much as they cant dispute the uniqueness of the city, newcomers acknowledge the challenges experienced by Venetians, such as the struggle to find affordable housing or jobs that are not related to tourism. One specific downside for the digital nomads is the scarcity of co-working space. Of course, there is the issue of living among hordes of visitors. The true challenge is not imagining that mass tourism will magically finish - that would be difficult - but creating an alternative, said Warglien. We need to create a model that maintains a normal urban life and is not only dependent on tourism.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/apr\/12\/remote-work-return-to-office-what-is-the-future-of-work","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/apr\/12\/remote-work-return-to-office-what-is-the-future-of-work","DATE":"2022-04-12 09:00:28","PLAIN_TEXT":"The world of work was already quite sick before the coronavirus took hold, but the pandemic put rocket boosters on cultural change. We can see the impact of this in every metric around work: during the Great Resignation of 2021, millions of American workers resigned en masse. Workers worldwide have declared that they would quit their jobs if not provided with flexibility. The reduction in corporate property rents last year as high as 10%, with huge changes in the use of office space and co-working space. And the city has a new competitor: the suburb. The flight to suburbia during the pandemic has accounted for a rise in the property market for residences outside city centers. For downtown districts to attract and retain people as places to live and work, city centers will need to be redesigned completely. These developments come as no surprise: the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that up to a quarter of workers in advanced economies will work permanently on a hybrid basis, ie partly from home, several days a week. Discussions about RTO (returning to the office) are increasingly fraught and in flux. There is no uniform model or agreement. The case for going into an office regularly is having to be made to the workforce - and many are rejecting it. Meanwhile, CEOs have to grapple with employees who want more flexibility, the ability to work remotely and even the ability to choose their working hours - and this without a paycut. The degree of agency workers will be given - to be able to choose your place and hours of work - might well define us far more than previous classifications in the future. Being labeled a white-collar or a blue-collar worker could be replaced by being a hybrid have or hybrid have-not worker instead. People recognize that their work is a valuable commodity and they want to have a greater say in when and where they sell it In addition, up to half of Americas jobs are projected to be freelance by 2030 and two-thirds of employers now regard some form of remote work or hybrid work as the new norm. Many companies are declaring themselves fully remote, giving them a competitive edge over those requiring presenteeism. As more of us can now choose how to manage the time we spend working in a way that suits us rather than the traditional nine to five, discussions around the four-day week have reached an intensity never seen before. We are not yet anywhere near to the famous 15-hour working week John Maynard Keynes predicted in the 1930s, but his prediction seems newly relevant. People recognize that their work, and therefore their time, is a valuable commodity and they want to have a greater say in when and where they sell it. *** In spite of those changes, considerable ambivalence remains among some leaders. In one camp, you get the hardliners who believe working from the office is best. Many feel that those who work from home are to some extent work-shy. At the very least, they wish to penalize people who prefer to work hybrid. Take the bombastic internal memo sent by James Gorman, chair and CEO of Morgan Stanley, to his staff: If you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York. None of this Im in Colorado ... and getting paid like Im sitting in New York City, echoing an equally robust statement from David Solomon of Goldman Sachs that working from home was an aberration. Interactive Similarly, the veteran Wall Street observer William Cohan simply said this: Heres my advice to you, fellow Wall Street drones: Get back to the office. In another camp are the more emollient hybrid softliners such as Kevin Ellis, London-based chair of consultancy firm PwC with 285,000 employees in 155 countries around the world, who said we want to enshrine new working patterns so that they outlast the pandemic. Regardless of which camp employers are in, it is obviously true that an awful lot of social capital resides in the office. I talked to Kevin Ellis, who said, My worry is that were going to create a glass ceiling for people whose careers will be stunted because theyre working from home and not realising what theyre missing out on. Nevertheless, all these comments reflect a wistfulness on the part of big business, which can no longer magically attract the same kind of worker prepared to work in the same way they did before the pandemic. Hybrid working reflects the fact that mobility and freedom are the new prizes for the professional working class. The shift to a placeless and timeless dimension for work means the fixed HQ will have to work a lot harder to attract and retain talent. Smart leaders are thinking the unthinkable and asking whether they need an office in the same way again Smart leaders today are thinking the unthinkable and asking whether they need an office in the same way again, not because they are following the hybrid herd, but because they are keeping their eyes and ears open to what is going on in their own businesses. Joanna Swash, CEO of outsourcing reception, PA and communications provider Moneypenny, was frank that her perceptions had been challenged by the pandemic when everyone had to go fully remote overnight. Before Covid-19 I thought weve got amazing offices, and that they are this space that everybody loves, she said. What I learned was that our culture was so strong that it wasnt just based on the office or on the physical environment, but it was based on that whole community feel, and how people trust each other. It should have been obvious to me, but that was a really big lesson at the start of the pandemic. A similar point was made by Chris Thurling, chair of Armadillo, a digital design firm which went fully remote during the pandemic, who expanded his business during this period: I want to remain completely open-minded about whether we ever need to have a traditional office again. If you look at the performance of our business since March 2020, we are performing really well and our clients are not saying theres been a drop-off in quality. Our profitability as a business has gone up and were growing. Why would we change too much? Bruce Daisley, an authority on the future of work and presenter of the podcast Eat Sleep Work Repeat, watches the hybrid work trend closely. He told me, Probably the most farsighted approach I have seen was Dropbox, which said late in 2020 that getting people into the office for a certain number of days or specific days doesnt work. Because people think, why am I going in to the office on Wednesday? Just because its Wednesday doesnt make any sense. People will come in to the office when they need to and they will come into the office for experiences. *** People will not come into the office, however, under duress. And if they do come, they will not stay loyal for long. In the summer of 2021, Google faced significant employee discontent when it announced that it intended to use its pay calculator to implement pay according to proximity to the office, reflecting the priority some employers still put on presenteeism. This strategy is risky and unfair, as Sarah OConnor commented in the Financial Times: If two workers from the same head office want to switch to working from home, but one inherited a house in an expensive city while the other had been living in a commuter town, is it fair for the latter to take a pay cut? She quoted Mark Zuckerberg of Meta telling his employees by video, Well adjust salary to location ... Therell be severe ramifications for people who are not honest about this. But who is not being honest? Some companies are clearly struggling to accept the serious shift in mindset and values of their talent Some companies are clearly struggling to accept the serious shift in mindset and values of their talent. It remains to be seen whether management will rise to the challenges of supporting home-based working or continue to believe they can persuade and cajole workers to be present in the office when they dont want to be. Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French broadcaster and columnist based in Paris, understands presenteeism as something else too: a feature of power politics. The French system hates hybrid, she said. Because the French boss wants to know what his subordinates are doing, very micro managing most of the time. A strict hierarchy prevails. And the fact that this hierarchy actually doesnt really work with the new ways of [hybrid] working means that innovation is slower in our country; sometimes its even sabotaged by people next to you who are vying with you for the bosss attention. If this sounds like the court of a minor Borgia or Louis XIV, minus the decor, thats where it comes from. In the end the question, for leaders who want their people back in the office is: why? Is it because regulating some work from home - finance especially - is legally complex? Is it optics? That management and leaders feel emotionally invested in high-spec, hi-tech, visible offices? Or is it a failure to comprehend the scale and sweep of change? Mobility and work is hardwired into us - the early 20th-century office workers came, as the great Chicago poet Carl Sandburg noted in Skyscraper, from the prairies to the city, to work a fixed day and then be poured out again back to the streets, prairies and valleys. The city became the fixed place and so too the office. But the arrival of the internet, followed now by the pandemic, has made a new centre of work: home, and a new form of mobility: the smartphone, which can work anywhere. The future of work cannot go back in time - it can only go forwards.

The visas will be offered to people who work remotely for enterprises outside Spain and who derive a maximum of 20% of their income from Spanish firms. As the law has yet to be passed there are still some details to be hammered out but it is expected that the visa - essentially a residency permit - will be initially valid for one year, renewable for up to five years depending on the applicants circumstances. Close relatives, such as a spouse or children, will be eligible to join the applicant. Applicants must be from outside the European Economic Area and be able to demonstrate that they have been working remotely for at least a year. They must have a contract of employment or, if freelance, show that they have been regularly employed by a company outside Spain. They must also demonstrate that they will earn enough to be self-sufficient and that they have an address in Spain. It is not clear yet whether they will have to undergo a criminal record check. For the first four years they will be taxed at 15%, rather than the standard 25% base rate. Spain joins 15 other European countries that offer some version of a digital nomad visa. Each country has its own set of conditions. In Croatia, for example, applicants must be earning at least EUR2,300 a month, in Estonia EUR3,500, in Iceland EUR7,100 and in Portugal only EUR700. Its thought that Spain will set a minimum monthly income of about EUR2,000. Greece introduced a digital nomad law in October 2021, offering residency of one to three years. Applicants must have a monthly income of EUR3,500. Some countries demand that you have cash in the bank - EUR5,500 in the case of the Czech Republic - as well as income. Some may also insist on private health insurance. Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona are already popular among the EUs digital nomads, with the latter proving a favoured destination for startups as the city aspires to become a technology hub and less dependent on tourism. Its easy to attract talent. Barcelona is small and densely populated and its cosmopolitan, says Sacha Michaud, who co-founded the Glovo food delivery business in the city. Staff at Glovo are international and so, in common with other startups in the city, the companys lingua franca is English. The Start Up law aims to smooth entrepreneurs path through the notorious Spanish bureaucracy. At present, it takes an average of 20 to 30 days to set up a company here, compared with one day in the Netherlands or the UK. Spain was ranked 30th in the World Banks ease of doing business report in 2020. Excellent 4G cover almost everywhere in Spain is tempting some nomads to set themselves up in rural areas where rents are very low. Internet speed is among the fastest in Europe and, at 148Mbps, almost double the UK speed of 75Mbps. However, for residents of cities such as Madrid and Barcelona, one negative effect is that nomads push up rents as people working remotely for US or UK companies can command much higher salaries and pay higher rents than locals. According to a report published this year, in Spain the average monthly salary is EUR1,751 (PS1,516), 20% less than the EU average of EUR2,194.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"technology\/2022\/nov\/10\/elon-musk-scraps-twitter-work-home-staff","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/nov\/10\/elon-musk-scraps-twitter-work-home-staff","DATE":"2022-11-10 12:20:51","PLAIN_TEXT":"Elon Musk has scrapped Twitters work from home policy and ordered its staff back to the office, days after firing 3,700 employees. The social media platforms new owner told staff in an email, seen by the Guardian, that its road ahead is arduous and will require intense work to succeed. The Tesla CEO added that working from home would no longer be allowed except in special circumstances, with such cases personally vetted by Musk. Remote work is no longer allowed, unless you have a specific exception. Managers will send the exception lists to me for review and approval, Musk wrote. He added that the new policy, first reported by Bloomberg, would be effective from Thursday for a minimum of 40 hours a week. The news comes as the company continues to shed staff. Musk fired about half of the companys 7,500-strong workforce last Friday, having bought it for $44bn (PS38.7bn) the previous week, and the chief information security officer, Lea Kissner, confirmed on Thursday she had left Twitter in the latest high-profile departure. Musk said Twitter had been hit by a pause in spending from advertisers that had caused a massive drop in revenue. Twitter makes most of its more than $5bn in annual revenue from advertising. The company has begun rolling out Twitter Blue, its new subscription service, in the UK. Users who pay PS6.99 a month get a blue tick next to their username, as well as early access to forthcoming features such as bookmark folders and the ability to change the colour of the app icon. Musk is hoping that Twitter Blue will reduce the companys reliance on advertising. Despite the chief executives promise last week that the international pricing of Blue would be adjusted proportionate to purchasing power parity, an economic measure of exchange rates that takes into account the cost of living in various countries, Musk seems to have given ground to Apple. The subscription service is billed through Apples in-app purchases, which locked Twitter into charging PS6.99 in the UK to match the $7.99 in the US. Musk tried to reassure advertisers about his plans for the company in a meeting on Twitters audio chat feature, Spaces, on Wednesday. Big brands including General Motors, United Airlines, the cereal maker General Mills and others have paused buying ads on Twitter as they watch whether Musks past comments that he is a free speech absolutist will lead to a rise in hate speech and divisive content on the platform. Brands on Wednesdays call included Deutsche Bank, Chevron, Nissan, Air Canada and Audi, which has paused Twitter ads. The American outdoor equipment retailer REI also attended and said after the call that its ads were still paused, according to Associated Press. Musk said during the call that he was still planning a moderation council that would tackle inappropriate content and consider account reinstatements, but it would take a few months to assemble. He said it would be advisory and not a command council. The mass layoffs have raised concern about the companys ability to maintain security on the platform and comply with government regulations. Those fears were compounded this week by the departure of three top security officials at the company, including Kissner, the chief privacy officer, Damien Kieran, and the chief compliance officer, Marianne Fogarty. In their absence, employees are being encouraged to self-certify the platform is running in compliance with privacy laws, according to a report from the Verge on Thursday. Breaking these laws could result in billions of dollars in fines. This comes after Twitter reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in May over privacy issues, under which it is required to perform privacy reviews before making changes to its products. The report suggested Musk had already bypassed its standard data governance processes relating to changes, and an internal lawyer told workers to seek whistleblower protection if you feel uncomfortable about anything youre being asked to do, according to the Verge.

Its the second outing I have spotted for this argument. In 2021, the Harvard Business Review asserted the value of commuting in setting and maintaining boundaries between work and home selves, thus avoiding burnout. Now the concept is back, with US researchers further exploring the role of the commute as a liminal space that allows for psychological detachment and recovery from work. There are psychological as well as physical and temporal dimensions to the commute, they argue, and the experience of rolelessness during it may create a mental space for psychological role transition and recovery. Im not sure anyone on a (supply your preferred failing rail operator here) commuter service is now enjoying their rolelessness or experiencing recovery.

Unsurprisingly, the researchers do note that on days when commutes were more stressful, participants reported less psychological detachment from work and less relaxation. The soul suck is real: I saw a tweet last week from someone whose commute neighbour had clipped his fingernail on to her lap. Yet, there is something in this idea that commuting can be mentally beneficial. My past commutes have been a mixed bunch: the best was the Brussels tram stuffed with garrulous eccentrics (including one man who mused for 20 minutes about whether it would be possible to milk a rabbit). The absolute nadir was schlepping to Brentford with morning sickness; the sight of an Upper Crust can still make me heave. Now Im working from home I dont stop working so much as lapse into blank staring. I used to walk the dog, but now hes so old and baffled by his own limbs, he barely gets through the front door before demanding to go back inside. Instead, I move to the sofa for more motionless sitting, frequently ignoring the large, bright rectangle in the corner of the room in favour of the small, sweaty rectangle in my hand, rationalising that someone might need me urgently. No one ever needs me urgently, but I will continue queasily poking my phone, perhaps doing some light catastrophising as I brush my teeth, then falling asleep to dream of mistakes and lawsuits. The bleed of work into not-work happens to everyone now that reminders are available in our pocket 247, but for homeworkers, especially, the blurred physical boundaries are bound to erode mental ones. Right-to-disconnect campaigners are valiantly trying to legislate around this and the wider expectation of workers being permanently available, but part of the problem is human nature, and that may be harder to address. I occasionally think longingly about the TV series Severance, in which the characters work and home selves are completely separate, a switch in their surgically altered brains flipped by their creepy corporation employer in the lift. Admittedly, its not - spoiler alert - an unqualified success. Perhaps a temporal liminal space does help. I asked how others wind down. Mostly it involved drinking. Other options included gardening, knitting, snacks, gaming, piano, lying on the bed and moaning or watching men try out labour simulators on YouTube. A French person suggested a sieste, which I assume means sex. Ive tried a couple of the suggestions. Alcohol: effective but probably unsustainable. Moaning: what I do all day. Gardening: at this time of year its just poking muddy sticks. Crisps are great - each crunch a tiny exhalation of stress - but Im still looking. We dont need to commute, but wherever we work, we need a way to assert we are more than our jobs, more also than parents or partners or people with dishwashers to empty and bills to pay. Whats yours?

Isnt it great now that flexible working has been normalised post-lockdown? What a boon for feminism. Its a powerful narrative. But its not the whole story. The federal governments Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) published its annual Gender Equality scorecard last month, highlighting that the gender pay gap has stagnated at 22.8%, despite advances in hybrid work arrangements. Harvard Business Review recently conducted research on stereotypes that showed women are often assumed to be less committed to their work and careers than men, especially if theyre mothers. With this as our (disappointing) baseline, we need to start thinking beyond remote working as a one-size-fits-all solution for workplace flexibility. Related: Working from home boosts womens job satisfaction more than mens, and that has a downside | Mark Wooden, Esperanza Vera-Toscano and Inga Lass for the Conversation In economic terms, countries measure underemployment (in contrast to unemployment) as the number of people who are in a job but would like to be working more hours. What this measure neglects is a more crucial metric that may hold the key to shifting the dial on the gender pay gap - something I will call the dark underemployment. Like the dark web, its something most people dont really understand, except to know that its bad. And a bit scary. This dark underemployment relates to seniority - and the accompanying salary differential. Yes, most women returning from maternity leave opt to delay a return to full-time hours. Of my circle of working mothers - all amazing go-getters - only one went straight back to full-time work after having a baby. Most tried, however, to maintain the senior role they had prior to having a baby in a part-time capacity, with the same story from their employer each time - your old role is full-time only. Years of hard work invested in building up a career, erased in one conversation. With women representing seven out of 10 primary caregivers, its a wonder we dont have a wider gender pay gap. Less than three years ago, it would have been inconceivable for many employers to see equivalent performance outcomes from their staff working in their activewear at their kitchen tables. Is job sharing the next frontier? Planned well, with the right match of people and division of responsibilities, workplaces may well find themselves getting two minds for the price of one, not to mention a healthy dose of loyalty and goodwill from both employees. In todays job market, thats quite the point of difference for employers jostling for talent. A study by the Melbourne Institute found that more men than women are working from home since the pandemic started. It is easier to work remotely in corporate and office-based roles, many of which are in male-dominated sectors. Jobs in the care-based industries - childcare, healthcare, aged care and teaching - are almost impossible to do remotely, except for some management and administrative roles. In childcare, a work-from-home arrangement would leave preschoolers to their own devices in a toddler version of professional wrestling. In health and aged care, at least until significant technological advances are applied more broadly across the sector, nurses working from home would leave patients dangerously unmonitored. And any parents of Victorian school-aged children may start rocking in the corner at the mention of remote learning. Common to all these sectors? They have female-dominated workforces. Women comprise around two-thirds of the education workforce and 80% of the healthcare and social assistance sectors. Related: Australian women will need more than 200 years to reach income equity with men Add to this the parenting double standard for those who do have the luxury of remote working. Consider this: a man is on a Zoom call and in wanders his little kid, climbs up on to his knee, with messy hair and mismatched clothes. The reaction is probably a collective awww from his colleagues on the call. They might think to themselves, what a guy! He must be so empathetic - look at him parenting while juggling a high-powered career! Now, consider the same situation, but instead its a woman. The uncomfortable truth is that at least one person on that call will be thinking something like this: why hasnt she organised childcare for her kids during work time? What if she has another baby soon? Dont get me wrong: being able to work from anywhere has significantly and positively changed the lives of many women - Im one of them. Yet the Zoom revolution has largely benefited men. Its time to expand our thinking beyond this dominant but ill-informed narrative and push forward on solutions such as job sharing as the next revolution in workplace flexibility. * Amy Bach is a healthcare manager, board director and mother of two","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2023\/jan\/31\/water-firms-in-england-urged-to-upgrade-sewage-works-for-new-homes","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2023\/jan\/31\/water-firms-in-england-urged-to-upgrade-sewage-works-for-new-homes","DATE":"2023-01-31 17:54:10","PLAIN_TEXT":"Campaigners are intervening to prevent new houses being occupied in several areas of England until sewage treatment works are upgraded to cope. In Oxfordshire, the Cotswolds and in Cumbria, the failure of water companies to invest in sewage infrastructure means new homes would just add more sewage into treatment works that are at or beyond capacity, and increase pollution into rivers, they say. The move comes as the regulator Ofwat continues its investigation into water companies for what it says are shocking failures in the way they run their treatment works and for potentially illegal dumping of raw sewage. Charlie Maynard, a Liberal democrat councillor on West Oxfordshire district council, said: The sewage treatment infrastructure owned by Thames Water is just not there to support existing housing let alone new developments. We have to do something, but at the moment there isnt any serious plan nationally as to what we are going to do about this massive underinvestment by water companies in sewage treatment works. For 30 years there have been wonderful dividends for investors from water companies, but these dividends should have been invested in our sewage systems. As a result of pressure from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (Wasp), councillors in West Oxfordshire have pushed for so-called Grampian conditions on developments, which state that they must not be occupied until Thames Water has invested to upgrade sewage treatment works to cope. A Grampian condition means a restriction is placed on a development until certain conditions have been met. Thames Water has included a condition on the development of 150 new homes in Long Hanborough to state no development should be occupied until confirmation that all sewage work upgrades required are completed or there is a phasing plan agreed to allow the development to be occupied. Another 40 homes in North Leigh will have a similar Grampian condition, which states that they must not be occupied until the Church Hanborough sewage treatment works is upgraded to cope. The West Oxfordshire area has a government target to build more than 10,450 new homes by 2031. But Maynard said the sewage infrastructure was a wasteland - treatment works were unable to cope with the current population, and pipe networks desperately needed investment to stop groundwater ingressing into the system and further overloading it. In Cumbria, local conservationist Matt Staniek is calling for a Grampian condition to be imposed to stop the occupancy of 40 new homes at Loughrigg until Ambleside sewage treatment works has been upgraded. Staniek, who set up the Save Windermere campaign, argues the lake could become ecologically dead because of the amount of sewage being pumped into it. Staniek said in his submission to the Lake District national park that without the upgrade of Ambleside treatment works to make sure it is operating legally within its environmental permit, granting consent for the development would endorse its intermittently illegal operation and increase the spilling of untreated and poorly treated sewage into the lake. In the last few years, I have observed the sharp and sudden degradation of our rivers and our lake, said Staniek. With dead fish floating in the lake, tributaries and algal blooms suffocating Windermere, its hard to ignore. I believe that the biggest contributor to the current decline of Windermere is the water company United Utilities, who service the local area. In 2021, there were more than 5,000 hours of raw sewage discharged from United Utilities wastewater treatment works into the Windermere catchment, according to data submitted by the water company to the Environment Agency. Lake Windermere is judged to be at only moderate ecological status under the Water Framework directive, which measures pollution. Significant phosphate pollution from sewage discharges is cited as the reason for not achieving good status. The impact of this is being felt across Cumbria - from the businesses that rely on the tourism that our lakes and rivers encourage to the health implications that swimming in polluted water has on those seeking to use it, said Staniek. Ashley Smith from Wasp, which has made 13 submissions regarding sewage capacity and new developments in West Oxfordshire and the Cotswolds, said: The idea that new housing is routinely nodded through to join inadequate sewage works by planners and water companies will shock most people. That some of those works will even be operating illegally yet ignored by all of the authorities supposedly acting in the public interest is a step too far and that is why Wasp is working with local councillors to end this money-making scam on the public. We are not aiming to hold up housing - we are aiming to force water companies to spend money when they should, not hang on to it for years after it was due. A Thames Water spokesperson said: Over the last five years we have requested planning conditions for waste networks andor waste treatment at 27 sites in West Oxfordshire. In addition, we are currently reviewing our advice on a small number of additional sites, at the councils request. A United Utilities spokesperson said: In 2020 we completed a multimillion pound upgrade at Ambleside WwTW [wastewater treatment works] which has raised the standard of treatment and ensures it has the capacity for growth from development and tourism up until 2036.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"science\/2022\/sep\/11\/cloud-labs-and-remote-research-arent-the-future-of-science-theyre-here","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2022\/sep\/11\/cloud-labs-and-remote-research-arent-the-future-of-science-theyre-here","DATE":"2022-09-11 12:00:30","PLAIN_TEXT":"Its 1am on the west coast of America, but the Emerald Cloud Lab, just south of San Francisco, is still busy. Here, more than 100 items of high-end bioscience equipment whirr away on workbenches largely unmanned, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, performing experiments for researchers from around the world. Im visiting via the camera on a chest-high telepresence robot, being driven round the 1,400 sq metre (15,000 sq ft) lab by Emeralds CEO, Brian Frezza, who is also sitting at home. There are no actual scientists anywhere, just a few staff in blue coats quietly following instructions from screens on their trolleys, ensuring the instruments are loaded with reagents and samples. Cloud labs mean anybody, anywhere can conduct experiments by remote control, using nothing more than their web browser. Experiments are programmed through a subscription-based online interface - software then coordinates robots and automated scientific instruments to perform the experiment and process the data. Friday night is Emeralds busiest time of the week, as scientists schedule experiments to run while they relax with their families over the weekend. There are still some things robots cant do, for example lifting giant carboys (containers for liquids) or unwrapping samples sent by mail, and there are a few instruments that just cant be automated. Hence the people in blue coats, who look a little like pickers in an Amazon warehouse. It turns out that they are, in fact, mostly former Amazon employees. Plugging an experiment into a browser forces researchers to translate the exact details of every step into unambiguous code Emerald originally employed scientists and lab technicians to help the facility run smoothly, but they were creatively stifled with so little to do. Poaching Amazon employees has turned out to be an improvement. We pay them twice what they were getting at Amazon to do something way more fulfilling than stuffing toilet paper into boxes, says Frezza. Youre keeping someones drug-discovery experiment running at full speed. Further south in the San Francisco Bay Area are two more cloud labs, run by the company Strateos. Racks of gleaming life science instruments - incubators, mixers, mass spectrometers, PCR machines - sit humming inside large Perspex boxes known as workcells. The setup is arguably even more futuristic than at Emerald. Here, reagents and samples whizz to the correct workcell on hi-tech magnetic conveyor belts and are gently loaded into place by dextrous robot arms. Researchers experiments are delocalised, as Strateoss executive director of operations, Marc Siladi, puts it. The Emerald Cloud Lab in South San Francisco. The laboratories are equipped with more than 200 types of scientific instrument that can be controlled remotely from a software command centre. Photograph: Emerald Cloud Automation in science is nothing new, especially in fields such as molecular biology, where much of the experimental work involves the laborious and repetitive transfer of tiny quantities of liquid from one vial to another. The disruption caused by the pandemic also encouraged a number of specialist facilities to develop ways to operate their equipment remotely. (The beams of the UKs powerful Diamond Light Source, for example, a particle accelerator that generates ultra-high energy radiation to investigate matter, can now be operated by users from anywhere in the world.) And outsourcing difficult or time-consuming elements of the experimental process is not new either. But Emerald and Strateos are different - these are the worlds first laboratories that in theory allow anyone with a laptop and credit card to pay and play with the entire reagent inventory and suite of instrumentation available in a world-class research facility. The appeal of this approach became obvious during the pandemic, when many researchers were unable to visit their own labs in person; the founders of cloud labs say this is the future of life science. The most obvious benefit is productivity: researchers can conduct several experiments at once and queue them up to run overnight or while they do other things. Our pro-users, theyll do the work of 10 scientists in a traditional lab, says Frezza. Theyll crank ridiculous numbers. Theres no time spent setting up and tearing down equipment, cleaning up, maintaining and fixing instruments or replenishing stock. Arctoris, a remote-operated drug discovery lab in Oxfordshire, says its platform has completed projects for pharmaceutical companies in 24 hours that might take at least a week in a traditional setting. Instead of pipetting for hours each day, researchers can spend more time thinking, reading, and analysing results with colleagues. Scientists at Pittsburghs Carnegie Mellon University were so impressed by what staff and students could do at the Emerald Cloud Lab - one researcher managed to recreate years of his PhD experimentation in a matter of weeks - that they recently asked the company to build another one, just for them. With a years worth of access to a cloud lab often costing less than the price of a single piece of high-end lab equipment, the dean of Carnegie Mellons college of science, Rebecca Doerge, says the model could be transformational. Im not interested in just changing science at Carnegie Mellon. Im interested in changing the process of science worldwide, she says of the new facility in Pittsburgh. We all have colleagues in under-resourced places that cant do the science that theyre capable of just because they dont have enough money. So with an internet connection and access to a cloud lab, this is a game-changer. A Strateos smart lab in San Diego. The company claims to have reimagined the laboratory as a smart data generation centre. Photograph: Strateos Doerge, a statistician turned science administrator, is also excited about removing variation and human error from experimental work. There will be no scientists based at the new 1,500 sq metre (16,000 sq ft) site, just half a dozen technicians helping the place run 24 hours a day. People still go to wet labs and they still stand there and they make mistakes. I dont think that everything is automatable in science, Im not saying that. Im just saying that the repetitive stuff, once you learn it, you dont need to stand there and do it over and over and over again. Scientists such as Doerge believe the precision of remote-operated labs could help fix what has become known as sciences reproducibility crisis - the worrying revelation that the results of troves of published research cant be replicated when different groups of scientists follow the same methods exactly. Plugging an experiment into a browser to be performed by robots forces researchers to translate the exact details of every step into unambiguous code. For example, what once might have been described in a scientific paper as mix the samples becomes detailed computer instructions for a certain machine to mix at a certain number of rotations a minute for a certain time. Other factors that could affect the result, such as the ambient temperature at the time, are captured in the metadata. Even though we must remember most people come from a good place, there are some pretty crazy people out there too As Doerge has encouraged more and more research - and even teaching - at Carnegie Mellon to be transferred to the remote labs, not all of her colleagues have been supportive. Many scientists think that working alongside colleagues at the bench and the sights and sounds of experimentation are what help generate exciting ideas and happy accidents. Others have concerns about the quality of data produced in labs theyve never set foot in. If I dont see it with my own eyes, it doesnt exist - Ive heard that from some of the senior faculty members, says Doerge. Its a mindset shift for sure. Some experts believe that making access to sophisticated labs this easy is a potential biosecurity or bioterrorism threat. In theory, small groups or even individuals with no research experience could use a cloud lab to start performing complex biological experiments. The labs are saying they only work with trusted partners, but of course they are very keen to open their market, says Dr Filippa Lentzos, an expert in biological risk and biosecurity at Kings College London. Even though we must remember most people come from a good place, there are some pretty crazy people out there too. Barriers are most definitely coming down if you want to deliberately do something harmful. Cloud labs say that they review all scheduled experiments and have systems to flag or reject any that appear illegal or dangerous. Plus, they argue, the complete digitisation of everything happening in the lab actually makes it easier to record and monitor what people are doing than in a traditional lab. Paul Freemont, co-founder of the UK Innovation and Knowledge Centre for Synthetic Biology, has helped develop several highly automated labs in the UK, including a robotic platform that was able to conduct more than 1,000 Covid tests a day early in the pandemic. He is not sure that remote-operated labs are yet mature enough to replicate what is available to scientists who set up their own automated equipment. I like the concept and think this is the way science is going to go. It would work if we had all the necessary protocols and workflows that a biologist might need, but I think thats not currently available to the level of complexity and detail that one needs. Scientists from Carnegie Mellon university. The institution has asked Emerald to build it a dedicated cloud lab. Photograph: Tim KaulenCarnegie Mellon University Freemont also has concerns about scientists not truly understanding or engaging with the software or the hardware that generates their data. You have to have the next generation of scientists understand how to build all this infrastructure themselves and how to work with it - you have to have some hands-on experience, surely. The potential for a few labs or big private companies to monopolise that understanding - I dont think would be very healthy. Despite these concerns, the appetite for cloud science is growing. Emerald is expanding capacity to keep up with demand, mostly from pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups. Strateos is working with the US research agency Darpa to study in detail how its facilities can improve reproducibility and efficiency of previous experiments and the company is also licensing its software so that other institutions can convert their facilities. In future, cloud labs may even decide what experiments to do themselves. As Googles DeepMind platform has recently proved, machine-learning tools can now gobble up decades worth of data and spit out answers to questions that would take scientists many years to solve with physical inquiry. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly using these tools to simulate molecular interactions in their search for new drugs. Data generated through cloud labs - which translate biology into an information technology - would only make these tools more powerful. Combining all these technologies could one day lead to systems that can develop theories and physically test them without human input. Already, some advanced Emerald Cloud Lab users have developed algorithms that adjust the parameters or direction of the next experiment based on their own data analysis. Its kind of wild stuff, very futuristic, says Frezza. All this means scientists are the latest profession to ask what the move towards automation and AI means for the future. Could more traditional research scientists one day find themselves out of a job? Its unlikely - after all, well always need people to prioritise which questions need answering and develop new ways to answer them. But the days of sitting at a bench in a white coat and gloves beside the flame of a Bunsen burner may soon be a thing of the past - the era of the robot researcher is coming.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"environment\/2022\/nov\/03\/greenwash-home-compostable-plastics-dont-work-aoe","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2022\/nov\/03\/greenwash-home-compostable-plastics-dont-work-aoe","DATE":"2022-11-03 08:00:09","PLAIN_TEXT":"Most plastics marketed as home compostable dont actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months, according to research. An estimated 10% of people can effectively compost at home, but for the remaining 90% of the population the best place to dispose of compostable plastics is in landfill, where they slowly break down, releasing methane, researchers say. If compostable plastic ends up among food waste, it contaminates it and blocks the recycling process, the study finds. The only solution is to use less plastic. The bottom line is that home compostable plastics dont work, said Prof Mark Miodownik, an author of the paper, published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainability. Lets just stop. Lets not pretend to ourselves that its going to be some sort of panacea, and you can sell people stuff without really having infrastructure to deal with the waste and hope that its all going to go away. The study showed that most of the plastic that people put in their home compost shouldnt be there anyway. Researchers found 14% of plastic packaging items were certified industrially compostable and 46% have no compostable certification (for example they could be 100% biodegradable, which typically means it cannot be composted). People are confused by the labels, and struggle to work out what goes where, yet 85% of people remain enthusiastic about buying compostable plastics, the report said. The Big Compost Experiment is using citizen science to assess biodegradable and compostable plastics in UK home composting. Photograph: Courtesy of UCL Plastic Waste Innovation Hub People want them to work, said Miodownik, who is part of University College Londons Plastic Waste Innovation Hub. People are really trying to do the right thing, mostly, so I feel bad for them that its turned out this way. But actually, home composting just doesnt work, he said. Researchers based their findings on data from 9,700 people across the UK who completed a survey called the Big Compost Experiment about their understanding of plastic waste, 1,600 of whom took part in a home composting experiment, and 900 completed it. Those that took part had a range of composters, from indoor wormeries to outdoor trenches. Participants used spades, trowels and sieves to go through their compost and look for traces of plastic before recording results online. If 90% of the carbon in the test materials had disappeared within six months it was considered compostable. The results showed there was no specification that was reliably home compostable. The study also suggests that the laboratory tests for these materials dont work, which is a wider issue for the plastics sector, and calls into question whether these product standards really protect the environment. I think if people continue to market home compostables, its greenwash, said Miodownik. Before it was unclear, but now we have the evidence. People are making claims for material without much understanding of what has to happen in order for it to actually be biodegradable. Compostable plastics should degrade into compost at a similar rate to naturally compostable materials, leaving no visible residue. Common uses for compostable plastic include food packaging, magazine wraps, bags, cups, plates and cutlery. Related: Wild ways: how readers have been helping wildlife in their gardens The term biodegradable refers to a material being degraded by biological activity, but is not specific about how long that might take and under what conditions. In 2019, another team of researchers found plastic bags that claimed to be biodegradable were still able to carry shopping three years after being buried in the soil and sea. The growth in recyclable, compostable and reusable plastics is a result of attempts to tackle plastic pollution but there are few places to dispose of them. There is, for example, no UK-wide system of collection for compostable and biodegradable plastics. In-vessel composters, where the composting takes place in an enclosed environment, are best at breaking down industrially compostable materials, but food waste is generally sent to anaerobic digesters, which cannot process them. Reduce and reuse are often big money savers for everyone, and yet it seems the strategy that is least intuitive to people, said Miodownik. If your local authority uses industrial composting to process food waste then you should use compostable bags, but this is rare in the UK. Most food waste is processed using anaerobic digesters, which turn the waste into biogas. All bags are removed as part of this process - which takes time and energy - if they are compostable or not. If possible, putting local authority food waste in newspaper would be better. However, the bottom line is that recycling food waste is a big win environmentally, and should be encouraged, even if people do use plastic bags to do it. For home composting, using no bag or paper is the best option.

JPMorgan Chases CEO, Jamie Dimon, has publicly complained about remote work and Zoom, which he refers to as management by Hollywood Squares. And unlike the Apple employees, Dimon believes that returning to the office will aid diversity. Elon Musk has jumped into the debate, telling his employees that hes happy for them to work from home, as long as theyve worked 40 hours in the office. A Stanford economist says that working from home is fueling growth at companies around the world and other studies support his claim, with one finding that 77% of workers reported increased productivity when operating remotely. However, there are other reports that conclude that those who work full-time at home are 70% less productive than those who dont work from home. And what about mental health? Many experts feel that working from home has the potential to reduce stress levels because theres no daily commute, you can sleep a bit longer, family commitments are easier to manage and youll likely achieve a better level of concentration without the distraction of office chatter and telephones. But one study from the American Psychiatric Association found that a majority of employees working from home say they experienced negative mental health impacts, including isolation, loneliness and difficulty getting away from work at the end of the day.

It feels like I wake up, go to the next room, work, log off, go back to the next room, rinse and repeat, he adds. I dont feel like myself and feel very emotionless. It is still difficult to parse the real benefits and costs of this extraordinary experiment so many of us have taken part in. But there is one answer we will soon agree on: all companies will need to let their employees work from home - just maybe not as much as some would like. Im seeing a compromise already happening among my clients, and that compromise comes down to just one word: hybrid. Many younger workers were begging their bosses to allow them to work from home long before the pandemic struck. And many older employers resisted them. Then along came Covid. And what happened? We, as small business owners, were forced to send our employees home and it was fine! They were right. We should have listened. Now we have no choice. That doesnt mean we allow people to work from home all the time. Or that we force them to come to our offices all the time. Even the most vocal supporters of remote working I know admit that spending some face time with colleagues is beneficial - particularly for young people who need mentors around them. Or for people who desire to be around other people. Or for those who are easily distracted, prone to loneliness or who suffer from certain anxieties. Its also beneficial for groups that need to collaborate, for people to share their ideas, and for workplaces where the culture depends on social activities, camaraderie and teamwork. Which is why the end of the work-from-home debate is on the horizon. Workers and business owners know that a compromise is inevitable. My clients already agree with their employees that some days in the office are good. And a few days at home are also good. Hybrid. Theyre allowing their managers to decide what working arrangements are best for their teams. Theyre supporting employees who work from home with good technology and security. Theyre demanding that workers be available during the work day and that they come to the office when required. Some employees I know prefer going into the office every day. Others not at all. The choice is theirs, as long as they meet the companys minimum requirements and their managers are satisfied. Will we still be debating work from home a year from now? I dont think so. Because, unlike some of the other issues created by the pandemic, a hybrid work environment is already putting this one to rest. I just hope that my older clients recognize this. Because if they continue to resist, theyll lose out on great talent.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2023\/mar\/10\/what-have-the-past-three-years-taught-us-about-hybrid-working","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2023\/mar\/10\/what-have-the-past-three-years-taught-us-about-hybrid-working","DATE":"2023-03-10 12:02:03","PLAIN_TEXT":"Almost three years have passed since the first work from home mandate was introduced - and many peoples working lives have never been the same since. Some employees have never returned to a physical office, while others are adjusting to hybrid working. So what lessons can recent research teach us about how to make flexible arrangements work better? Dont fixate on the number of days Many companies are still fixated on the number of days that employees should be in the office, with blanket policies for all staff. More appropriate would be to examine the type of tasks employees do and work from there, said Prof Jonathan Trevor at the University of Oxfords Said Business School. Based on interviews with managers from 20 global companies, Trevor and his colleague Prof Matthias Holweg have developed a framework to help businesses navigate these tensions. They found that workplace tasks tend to fall into four general categories: focused creative tasks, such as designing a brochure; individual procedural tasks, such as data entry; coordinated group tasks, such as routine project work; and collaborative creative tasks, such as product development. Focused creative tasks are the easiest to transition to virtual work, because they require little teamwork and are easily supported by technology, while collaborative creative tasks are the hardest because they require access to the collective hive mind. If you are in that mode of work, then maybe it is appropriate you should have more time in the office, whereas if youre doing individual focused work, the balance may be more weighted towards virtual working, Trevor said. Find new ways to build corporate culture and identity Weaker workplace ties could result in lower levels of staff loyalty and engagement. If staff rarely see senior leaders or socialise with colleagues, it can be difficult to establish a strong organisational culture - the collection of traits that make a company what it is. Weak organisational cultures tend to be associated with higher levels of conflict and mistrust. Spending some time in the physical workplace is therefore desirable - for everybody - but better orchestration of the virtual community is also necessary, Trevor said. Managers need to develop skills to manage people in a virtual way that still keeps them engaged and helps them to identify with the organisation they are working for, he added. ... and spot stress Individuals tend to express stress or unhappiness differently, and managers or teammates may be less able to provide support if they rarely see each other in person. Hybrid working also creates new sources of stress, such as remembering to bring crucial documents or equipment into the office, and not having a straightforward daily routine. Also, while working from home removes the stress of the daily commute, work days can be more intense. Remote working is often a highly productive way of working, said Prof Christine Grant, an occupational psychologist at the University of Coventrys Centre for Healthcare Research. People may feel a pressure to keep on working, or want to keep on working, which impacts on their wellbeing. Encouraging staff to complete a wellness action plan could help. Basically, people write down the signs theyre likely to show if theyre struggling, the type of things that may cause them difficulty, and the type of support theyd like, said Prof Gail Kinman, an occupational health psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London. Avoid unnecessary virtual meetings Back-to-back virtual meetings can be stressful. Photograph: Fly View ProductionsGetty Images Virtual meetings are very different to meeting people in person - they are often quite focused; you get the meeting done, then move on to the next thing. Its a very intense way of working, said Grant. The temptation to multitask can leach further brainpower, and video-call participants must work harder to send and respond to non-verbal signals compared with meeting face-to-face. It is also unnatural - and somewhat stressful - to watch a recording of your own face, or to hold such prolonged eye-contact with other people, research suggests. It has been said that there are only two types of situation where you would be so close to other peoples faces: One is if you were going to hit them, the other is if you were going to kiss them, said Kinman. Recognise that not everyone benefits from working at home Very junior staff often do not have the space at home to make work comfortable. They also benefit a lot from the kind of on-the-ground learning from colleagues, and the socialisation that happens in the office, said Prof Kerstin Sailer, an expert in the sociology of architecture at University College London. Senior people often like being in the office and getting that kind of cross-functional overview between different roles and teams, or managing by presenteeism. There are also staff for whom online meetings may be immensely challenging, such as those with sensory impairments or neurodiversity. Yet home working might help some neurodivergent individuals, by limiting social interactions and providing greater control over their environment, said Grant, who has been studying this issue. Create a virtual commute A significant problem with home working is the blurring of peoples work and personal life. Although a lot of people dont like commuting, it does provide a kind of physical buffer zone between work and home, said Kinman. Finding alternative ways to separate the workday from home life, and switch off the brain, is therefore important - whether thats cycling around the block, doing a meditation exercise or dancing around your kitchen. Rest if youre ill Working while sick can intensify feelings of detachment from your job. Photograph: imtmphotoAlamy Working while sick is something weve found has become much more common during the pandemic, said Kinman. In some ways it can be beneficial, because if your colleagues know youre ill, you may be able to push out some of the unnecessary stuff and be more productive. But there are definite downsides: by not allowing yourself time to switch off, you are more likely to take longer to recover, and be at higher risk of future ill health - including mental health problems. Working while sick can also intensify feelings of detachment from your job, research suggests. Rethink office design If your workplace is now predominantly a site for team-building and creative group meetings, there may be less need for individual desks, and a greater need for additional meeting rooms and break-out spaces. Organisations are increasingly viewing their offices as social and collaborative hubs, said Sailer, who recently published a hybrid office how-to guide. It is possible that with hybrid working, companies may need less office space than before the pandemic, but this office space needs to be of premium quality and designed in a way that encourages attendance. Rather than reverting to the default office equals desks, and everyone in five days a week, Sailer believes organisations should see the Covid pandemic as an opportunity to rebuild the workplace from the bottom up, so every day spent in the office is worth it.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2023\/feb\/14\/working-from-home-revolution-hybrid-working-inequalities","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/feb\/14\/working-from-home-revolution-hybrid-working-inequalities","DATE":"2023-02-14 15:13:20","PLAIN_TEXT":"A few days ago, I witnessed first-hand what working from home was doing to our society. It was a normal work day, and I rushed from my home to the local tube station. As I descended the stairs, I steeled myself for the usual crush of the Central line. But when the train whooshed into the station and I boarded, something seemed odd. It was 8.50am, I was heading into the City of London, and there was a seat available. In fact, there was not just one seat - I counted about 10 free seats on my carriage. Usually you would be lucky to find standing space, so I was trying to figure out what was wrong. I soon realised that it was Friday - the most popular day for employees to work from home. During the past few years, we have witnessed a revolution in working life. When home working became more common during the Covid pandemic, many assumed this would be a temporary change. Yet according to data released this week by the Office for National Statistics, between September 2022 and January 2023, 16% of the workforce still worked solely from home, while 28% were hybrid workers who split their time between home and the office. Even more than this - 40% - had worked from home at some point in the past seven days, compared with just 12% in 2019. This reflects global trends. A survey of employees in 27 countries found that working from home is becoming much more of a norm. Employees in this sample spent an average of 1.5 days working from home. The UK average was 2 days. But what the data makes starkly clear is that the working from home revolution has not touched everyones lives equally. The ONS survey found that workers on salaries of more than PS50,000, people with degrees, Londoners and white people had the highest rates of home or hybrid working - and were less likely to be required to go in every day. This reminds us that working from home is only a reality for a fairly small part of the workforce. There are many people working in the service, care and transportation sectors, for instance, who cant work from home at all. There is a real danger that these trends entrench existing inequalities, and that the working from home revolution may pass by those who would benefit most. Parents with dependent children had only slightly higher rates of hybrid working, while the rates among those with long-term illnesses or disabilities were roughly the same as the overall average. Working from home hugely benefits workers: they gain on average 72 minutes a day, have higher job satisfaction and are less likely to quit. Its rise has sparked something of a moral panic among some bosses, but this misses the fact that working from home is generally also good for employers. It dampens wage inflation, it means employees are more productive - and employees spend about half of those extra 72 minutes on work. A study of an engineering firm that introduced working from home policies found that employees were 33% less likely to quit and more likely to say they were satisfied. Engineers in this study wrote 4.4% more lines of code when working from home. Another study based on UK data found that employees who worked from home reported high levels of productivity and spent more time working when they were at home. This was particularly true for employees such as professionals and managers who had high levels of autonomy over their work. Related: Ive finally found the perfect accessory for my work-from-home setup: a fellow human | Nell Frizzell A final benefit of working from home for employers that was unearthed in a recent study is that it can help bosses to control their wage bills. In recent months most companies have seen employees demanding large pay rises so their pay packets keep pace with inflation. It seems that employees are willing to trade off small amounts of pay for their ability to work from home. One study found that the working from home reduced wage growth by about two percentage points over two years. Some managers have initially struggled to know how to manage their employees when they are out of sight. However, it is interesting to note that evidence suggests that after about six months of managing people remotely, bosses get used to it and adopt new tactics. Often this means less informal interaction and more use of electronic monitoring. A survey by the Atlanta Fed found that 41% of businesses in its sample had increased communication with staff via phone and video call, while 28% had introduced more frequent check-ins and formal reviews. This might make life easier, but there is a danger of employees wider social networks in the office becoming less dense. One Australian study found that employees working from home could feel lonely and isolated. However, this could be circumvented by ensuring people got support from their colleagues (other than their bosses), and spent at least some time in the same location. Working from home doesnt benefit everyone - some jobs could never be done remotely, and retail and transport companies are having to adjust to significant falls in footfall and usage. Overall, though, this revolution could change work and our lives outside work for the better - but to do so, it must be accessible to more than just the highest paid, most privileged workers.

Which is to say, I birthed two babies in relatively quick succession, looked at the cost of childcare (PS42.5k a year for a baby and a two-year-old in my part of London, towards which the government will contribute up to PS2k a child under the tax-free childcare scheme), and decided that staying home made more sense than putting them in nursery and desperately trying to earn enough to break even. Im far from alone in that calculation. Current data suggests theres roughly 1.34 million stay-at-home parents in the UK. Although the percentage of dads is increasing, the vast majority are mothers. According to the Department for Educations childcare and early years survey of parents, about half would prefer to do some paid work if childcare were more affordable. On the flip side, the thinktank Civitas has estimated there are more than 2 million mums of young children whod prefer to reduce their hours, but work out of financial necessity. What could better exemplify the damned if you do, damned if you dont vibe that seems to characterise every aspect of modern parenting? Personally, Id like to work. Ideally just evenings and weekends to begin with, to avoid my entire income disappearing on childcare costs, and potentially full-time once my oldest starts school. Since the term after she turned three, shes been eligible for some funded nursery hours, but the subsidy doesnt stretch as far as you may think. The much-touted 30 hours of free childcare for working parents is term-time only, so over a full year it averages out at 22 hours a week. Factor in travel, and thats less than half of what you need to hold down a full-time job. I want to work because the extra income would be helpful, because evening work feels more realistic now my youngest is sleeping better and, if Im honest, because Im aware of the prevailing belief that the way I currently spend my days is basically valueless. As my household is not in receipt of universal credit, Ill be spared a chiding letter from Hunt urging me to put down the wet wipes and do something more useful. It seems unlikely those letters will do much to achieve their official goal usefully deflects blame for the catastrophe that is the British economy from themselves. Say what you want about Nadhim Zahawi, but the man is undeniably economically active. As a society all the evidence suggests we simply dont consider childrearing a valuable activity. Photograph: Adrian SherrattAlamy Though middle-class stay-at-home mums are excluded from the official government shaming campaign, cultural stereotypes of non-working mothers are pretty similar across the board. From the glossy, gym-bunny wives of CEOs and bankers to young, single mums in social housing, in the eyes of many were just different varieties of parasite. And if anything, attitudes towards stay-at-home dads may be even more negative, due to lingering, gendered assumptions. I could try to persuade you that, actually, looking after small children seven days a week is quite full-on. I could talk about the social isolation, about the intensity of always, always being needed, about the guilt at feeling touched out, and not being able to divide myself in two when theyre vying for my attention. Whats the point, though? Id effectively be begging you to consider childrearing a valuable activity when all evidence suggests that, as a society, we simply dont. Just look at how the professionals are treated. Full-time nursery care for two under-threes doesnt cost more than median take-home earnings because childcare workers are living high on the hog. Early years provision is expensive because, to provide safe, quality care, you need a high ratio of staff to kids. The only way to make it affordable, while compensating workers fairly, is to massively expand government subsidies. Labours proposal to expand the 30 hours funding to under-threes is a step in the right direction, but it wont help all families. Even with that extra support, it would still cost PS23,800 to send two kids to my local nursery full time - about three-quarters of take-home pay if you earn the national median salary (PS33k) and have a student loan on repayment plan one. Related: Childcare is important but quality and quantity decide who benefits most | Torsten Bell Childcare struggles aside, another issue for parents hoping to return to work is that our confidence tends to be at rock bottom. I basically dont believe that anyone will want to hire me. When friends send me job listings, or suggest possible career pivots, I suspect them of humouring me. Some days, I doubt that I have any marketable skills whatsoever. Of course, you could argue thats an unusually healthy level of self-awareness for someone with a background mainly in opinion writing - but I know far more accomplished women whove taken a few years away from the workplace to raise children and suffer similar self-doubt. To some extent, its unavoidably going to be daunting, searching for work after a significant break, but widespread cultural disdain for stay-at-home parents does not help. When research suggests that even women who might have children are discriminated against in job interviews, what chance does someone who has demonstrably prioritised childrearing have? I know that many people do successfully return to work after a stint at home, albeit often in a more junior and lower-paid role, but Im struggling to believe Ill pull it off myself. Instead of targeting partners of universal credit recipients with nagging letters, perhaps Hunt could send all stay-at-home parents a good luck card.

The lower floor, meanwhile, is dedicated to children and includes a family room, guest room, office and bedrooms. Both floors have direct access to the garden.

As Britain is expected to be the only major industrialised country to see its economy shrink this year, amid rising interest rates and higher taxes, the government is frantically trying to find ways to boost economic growth. With the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, having launched an inquiry into why hundreds of thousands of people have left the workforce recently, and the Treasury keen to get more people into full-time work, the question of why more people arent increasing their hours amid a persistent shortage of workers has once more moved centre stage. More than 8 million people - a quarter of the UK workforce - are in part-time work now, the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Influential Tory backbenchers are putting pressure on the chancellor to introduce a range of measures to help make childcare more affordable so parents can get back to work. In a keynote speech at Bloomberg last month, Hunt urged early retirees and those struggling to find a new job to rejoin the workforce. We need you, and we will look at the conditions necessary to make it worth your while, he said. Jeremy Hunt during his first major speech as chancellor he declared that declinism about Britain was wrong in the past and it is wrong today. Photograph: Jordan PettittPA But for more than a decade now, due to a range of Conservative policies, families working full-time across the income spectrum have been finding themselves earning less money than if they worked part-time. William, 58, a single father from Bedfordshire, is one of several people who told the Guardian that they would like to work more, but are financially better off for reducing their hours. He works 11 hours a week as a community care worker, visiting elderly clients in their own homes. Ive reduced my hours because Im receiving universal credit. If I work over a certain number of hours or earn over PS334 a month, my award is reduced. This means that I dont get paid for some of the hours worked in real terms. My job requires that I use my car and although I receive a mileage allowance, this gets added to my take-home pay and again my UC award is reduced, so effectively I dont receive the money I lay out for fuel. William has calculated that he would have to nearly triple his hours to 32 a week to be better off by PS100 a month. Believe me, Id love to work more hours, but its just not worth it. He expects that he will have to quit care work and find a different job when new rules requiring some universal credit claimants to work more hours come into effect. If this affects me Ill be forced to leave the care profession and work in a shop or factory instead, without fuel costs. Its those kinds of things that prevent people from staying in the care sector and other fields of work. Kate Mitchell, 39, a mother of two from Guildford, who used to earn a PS40,000 annual salary in a private consultancy, said unaffordable childcare as well as commuting costs to London led her to reduce her hours. Kate Mitchell, pictured with her two children, says there are no financial incentives for her to work full-time in her professional job. Photograph: Kate MitchellGuardian Community Mitchell now works 25 hours, remotely, earning PS1,100 a month. She pays nursery costs of about PS700 a month, which would rise to PS1,595 for a full-time place, including 15 free hours of government-funded childcare a week. Together with after-school club fees and around PS400 commuting costs Id have to spend more on going to work than Id be earning full-time in a London office, wed be financially worse off than if I didnt work at all. Im now making a profit of around PS350 a month. Id love to work more, to get back into the career I spent a decade building. Ive put any kind of ambition on hold, there is just zero incentive to try and earn more. A number of middle and higher earner couples told the Guardian that punitive childcare costs and income taxation meant that going part-time and generating income through property ownership was financially more lucrative than full-time employment. A couple from Cheshire, a primary school teacher and an engineer, said they had both reduced their hours to save about PS2,000 monthly in childcare fees, resulting in roughly the same financial circumstances as when they were working full-time. I cant see us ever going back to full-time work as our better work-life balance is priceless, so I do worry about our pension contributions, one of them said. Ive increased mine to counter the reduction in pay and were looking into getting a rental property to make up the difference. Between July 2021 and July 2022, the average UK house price increased by PS39,000, meaning many homeowners earned more money with their house than in their job, as the current average salary for full-time UK employees is PS33,000 as of November 2022, according to ONS. Families on middle and higher salaries feel the effects of the Treasurys fiscal drag - resulting in a steady erosion of take-home pay.

Im a captain, and the only reason Im still working full-time is because my pension pot is small, due to time abroad. I currently contribute the maximum PS40,000 to my pension, but in a few years Ill absolutely go part-time, like a significant number of my colleagues already have, to avoid paying an effective tax rate of 62% [including 2% national insurance, on income between PS100,000 and PS125,140 due to the loss of the personal tax-free allowance].

Millions of people across the UK are currently working flexibly, which can take various forms including working from home, job-sharing, compressed hours, flexitime and part-time and term-time-only working. On Monday the government said it would introduce legislation giving employees the right to request such arrangements from the moment they start a job. It also said about 1.5 million low-paid workers, including some gig economy employees, students and carers, would benefit from a new law ensuring they are free to boost their income by taking on a second job if they wished. Surveys from companies such as the insurer Royal London show many people increasingly view flexibility as an important or even non-negotiable requirement when applying for jobs, and with companies wrestling with a chronic shortage of workers, growing numbers of employers are having to offer these working patterns if they want to recruit and keep staff. However, some workers told a TUC survey they would not feel comfortable asking for flexible working in a job interview for fear of the response. On Monday, ministers said they planned to make flexible working the default. However, critics have pointed to government clashes with civil servants and unions over the issue of home working. In October 2021, the cabinet minister Oliver Dowden said civil servants working from home should get off their Pelotons and get back to their desks. Earlier this year the then minister for government efficiency, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was criticised for leaving condescending notes on the desks of civil servants who were not in the office, in an effort to discourage working from home. Under the current law, all employees can make a flexible working request after 26 weeks in a job. One request can be made every 12 months, and employers have three months to respond, with broad criteria for rejection and no right to appeal. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said millions of employees would be able to ask for flexible working from day one of their employment under its new legislation. Employers will be required to discuss other options before rejecting a request - for example, if it is not possible to change an employees working hours on all their days, they could consider making the change for some days. BEIS also said that workers on contracts with a guaranteed weekly income below the lower earnings limit of PS123 a week would be protected against exclusivity clauses that restrict them from working for multiple employers. It added that while not everyone will want a second job, this move would remove unnecessary red tape that prevented those who did, such as some gig economy workers, younger people and those with caring responsibilities who were unable to commit to a full-time role. However, BEIS did not give a timescale for the legislation. Frances OGrady, the TUCs general secretary, pointed out it had been a year since a consultation on flexible working closed and people were tired of waiting for action. OGrady said that allowing requests for flexible arrangements from day one was a step in the right direction but the government needed to go much further to ensure flexible work now becomes the norm. She added: Ministers must change the law so that every job advert makes clear what kind of flexible working is available in that role. And they should give workers the legal right to work flexibly from their first day in a job - not just the right to ask.

Experts have raised concerns that the post-Covid return to work is entrenching the gender pay and promotion gap, with employers failing to monitor its impact or properly design jobs for hybrid and remote working. This especially affects women, who are more likely to choose flexible hours or work from home for childcare reasons. Male managers are significantly more likely to mostly or completely work from the office (48% v 38%), according to a survey of 1,300 managers from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI). Two in five (40%) managers surveyed said they had already observed opinion or behaviours suggesting an inequality between those who work flexibly and those who do not. Female managers were more likely than their male counterparts to believe hybrid working could negatively affect career progression. Anthony Painter, the director of policy at the CMI, said: Women could end up in a lose-lose situation if employers arent careful, needing to balance work and home life through flexible working but missing out on many opportunities that arise through in-person office interaction. That is intolerable and damaging for women and employers alike. The CMIs findings were echoed in a recent Deloitte Women at Work report, which found 60% of female hybrid workers felt they had been excluded from meetings, while almost half worried that they did not get the exposure to leaders necessary for career progression. Female hybrid workers reported more instances of being excluded from informal but important interactions and conversations, being given opportunities to speak in meetings, and having colleagues take credit for their ideas. Prof Rosie Campbell, the director of Kings College Londons Global Institute for Womens Leadership, said the impact of hybrid working on female career advancement was something she was concerned about, and it required more research. She said hybrid working could worsen the existing two-tier workforce for those who work flexibly and get stuck in the mommy track, unable to progress in their careers, by creating a three-tier workforce of people who are in the office all the time, those who are hybrid, and those who are fully remote. She said there was huge variability between employers in terms of how visibility, presenteeism and overwork affect promotion opportunities. Anecdotally it seems in male-dominated sectors with high prestige such as financial services, there is real pressure to get into the office as many days as possible, and I think thats deliberately exclusionary, she said. The solution, she suggested, was for hybrid jobs to be carefully designed rather than allowed to develop on their own, because existing inequalities might be reinforced. Sarah Forbes, a senior lecturer at the University of York and co-director of the Equal Parenting Project, said flexible working risked reverting to pre-pandemic levels unless more men were persuaded to work from home. Even before Covid-19, flexible working had some negative impacts on womens careers. Until both men and women are as likely to use all forms of flexible working, women will experience stigma, she said.There is also a real class divide between those who can access flexible work, said Nikki Pound, a womens officer at the Trades Union Congress. Office workers, who are typically in higher-paid, professional roles, have gained more flexibility since the pandemic, while shift workers, for example in healthcare, retail and hospitality, are increasingly forced to accept shift patterns that benefit their employers needs rather than their own. We want to make it the norm for everyone, whether you have caring responsibilities, or to manage sickness or disability, Pound said.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/sep\/25\/monitor-workers-at-home-security-cybercrime","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/sep\/25\/monitor-workers-at-home-security-cybercrime","DATE":"2022-09-25 11:00:31","PLAIN_TEXT":"Should you be monitoring your work-from-home employees? Yes, but not for the reasons you might suspect. According to a recent report in the New York Times, eight of the 10 largest private US employers are using software and other technologies to track the productivity of their employees in the office and at home. A large insurance company installed software that measures how long employees were logged on to their computers and how much time they were spending on work-related activities. A social media company in Florida has software running on their employees work computers that takes screenshots of their desktop every 10 minutes and records how much time they spend on different activities, claim researchers at the Harvard Business Review. Why? So that the company can use the data to determine productivity levels and identify rule-breakers. The same report claims that Amazon tracks smartphone data for its delivery drivers to monitor their efficiency and identify unsafe driving practices. Surveillance is booming. Sales of employee monitoring software are through the roof, with products like Teramind, ActivTrak and Hubstaff offering features that range from tracking applications your remote employees are using and the websites theyre visiting to providing screenshots of their activities and monitoring their keystrokes. The industry is expected to grow from an annual sales rate of about $488m to $1.7bn by 2029. Wow. Companies appear to be spending a lot of time measuring the time that their employees are spending on the job. So should you be monitoring your employees too? Yes, you should. But not for the reason youre thinking. You should not be monitoring their productivity, their attentiveness, the number of clicks on their keyboard during the day or whether or not theyre doing actual work or watching YouTube. Its a waste of time and resources. It creates a toxic culture. And believe me, if some below-average employee is committed to wasting an employers time theyll figure out a way to do it without you knowing it. Treat your employees like the adults that they are and let them do their jobs Your employees are grownups. Theyre being paid to do what theyve promised to do in their job descriptions (and hopefully even more, if theyre good at what they do). So please: treat them like the adults that they are and let them do their jobs. You shouldnt care how long something takes and when its being done as long as its being done on time and with quality. You need to have the right metrics in place to be sure that theyre meeting the specific, quantifiable deliverables that youve given them. Thats it. But that doesnt mean you shouldnt be monitoring them while theyre working at home. Why? Because your remote employees - even your best ones - are still causing you a problem. A security problem. According to various sources, the FBI saw a 300% increase in reported cybercrime attacks since Covid-19 and cybersecurity predictions reveal that the US is going to be a soft target for more than half of cybercrime attacks in another five years. And the No 1 reason is because you and me and our employees are working more from home and our home environments are very insecure. Were using older versions of Windows or Apple iOS. Our routers probably have the same security codes that came from the factory (and which can be easily found online). Our passwords are weak. Our security software is out of date. Our computers are rife with viruses and malware. We lack training. We lack patience. We click and we download and we browse and we install all sorts of stuff without thinking. Oh, and were probably sharing our computers with our kids. What are we thinking? Because of this we need to be monitored. No, not our activities. But if youre running a small business you need to employ an IT firm to keep a close eye on each of your remote employees. That firm needs to make sure that your remote workers (and you) are running the most recent operating systems, have downloaded the most recent security software, are safely configured on their home networks and are using (and regularly changing) complex passwords. So heres my advice: dont worry if your employee is working on that project plan or buying shoes on Zappos. Instead, worry that your employee is doing something thats going to cause a serious security problem at your firm. For this reason and this reason only, you need to monitor them.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/nov\/10\/rise-in-back-pain-and-long-term-sickness-linked-to-home-working-ons","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/nov\/10\/rise-in-back-pain-and-long-term-sickness-linked-to-home-working-ons","DATE":"2022-11-10 17:39:29","PLAIN_TEXT":"Anybody who emerged from the Covid-19 lockdowns with a frozen shoulder or a neck crick after spending hours hunched over their laptop at the kitchen table would be painfully aware of the dangers of working from home. Now the nations number crunchers have provided evidence that remote working may be partly to blame for the UKs chronic labour shortage, with tens of thousands of extra people reporting as long-term sick due to lockdown related injuries. In a sign that poor ergonomics can have an impact on economics, the Office for National Statistics found a big rise in the number of people being unfit for work because of neck and back injuries. Overall, the ONS said the number of people identified as economically inactive because of long-term sickness had increased from 2 million to 2.5 million in the three years from 2019, with more than 70% of the rise - 363,000 - occurring after the arrival of Covid in early 2020. But a breakdown of the total showed that the number leaving the labour force because of neck and back problems rose by 62,000 - the second-largest reason cited. Gavin Burt, a registered osteopath and clinic director of Backs &amp; Beyond in London, said he was unsurprised by the ONS figures because he saw a significant increase in patients coming to him with back and neck problems, particularly people in their twenties. In an office you have a really well-designed ergonomic set-up, which helps to reduce repetitive strain injury (RSI) and back pain. But we never really think about ergonomics at home. Burt, a member of the General Osteopathic Council, added: People were working with one leg on the bed, one leg off the bed, in a slightly contorted position on their laptop or at uncomfortable dining chairs or sofas. Basically it is overuse injuries, in poor posture for longer than they would have done if they were working in an office. The ONS said older people continued to make up the majority of those inactive because of long-term sickness, but the sharpest relative increases in recent years had been among those aged 25 to 34. Long-term sickness in that age category rose by 42%, compared with a 16% jump for people aged between 50 and 64. Hugh Stickland, an ONS senior statistician, said: The largest increase came from people with other health problems or disabilities. While this category includes people affected by long Covid, we think thats only one of several contributing factors. The next highest rise was among people with back or neck problems; its possible that increased home working has given rise to these kinds of conditions. Burt said he had already noticed an improvement in some of his clients, which he attributes to the part-time return to office working, and the associated commute, particularly for those who travel on public transport. People often think of the commute as a chore, but it got people up and walking, Burt said. Ive already seen peoples conditions improve by moving to hybrid working, getting back on to the commute and once they are up and about and going somewhere else, it gives them the emotional space to think about exercise. The rising number of economically inactive people has been a key factor behind the labour shortages that have alarmed the Bank of England and contributed to higher interest rates this year. Lockdowns during the pandemic led to an increase in the number of economically inactive people reporting depression, bad nerves and anxiety as their main health condition in 2020 and 2021, but the ONS said numbers had now returned to pre-pandemic levels. Alison Carter, a researcher in HR leadership and wellbeing at the Institute of Employment Studies, said employers should focus on making sure their staff have workplace assessments for their office and home set-ups, From an employee wellbeing point of view, we need to encourage people back to work who are dropping off the radar and if musculoskeletal problems are the reason, there are physical workplace adjustments that can be made, she said.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/oct\/08\/leaseholders-working-from-home-legal-action-landlords-lease","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/oct\/08\/leaseholders-working-from-home-legal-action-landlords-lease","DATE":"2022-10-08 06:00:22","PLAIN_TEXT":"Some people who work from home or run a business from their flat or house could face legal action for violating the terms of their propertys lease, according to a legal academic. During the pandemic the number of people working from home ballooned, and many have continued to operate from their flats and houses after the Covid restrictions were lifted. Some people keen to use their property for Airbnb rentals have already been warned about the risk of legal action if the lease, which dictates what their home is used for, prevents it. Now some of those who work for their employer or operate a business from their home - which could include people running a nail bar, music teachers and even builders storing construction supplies - could face legal challenges. Leases frequently contain restrictive clauses - for example, they may say the property can only be used as a residence for a single family, or it cannot be used to run a business. Michael Poulsom, a senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University Law School, says it is likely to be only a matter of time before litigation by landlords takes place to halt or restrict the practice. In England and Wales, covenants which prohibit the use of residential property for the purposes of a trade or business, otherwise than as a single private dwelling house are very common in both freehold and leasehold titles, and whether working at home breaches those covenants remains in large part unresolved, he says. Poulsom estimates that half of the properties in England and Wales could have these restrictive covenants which prevent business use. This is of particular concern for leasehold owners, against whom the landlords remedy of forfeiting the lease is a possibility. While landlords may have ignored people violating the terms of the lease during the pandemic, Poulsom suggests this may now change and prompt legal action. Breaching the terms of the lease can have serious consequences for the resident. This can start with notice being given, all the way up to court action to forfeit the lease, which effectively means the lease is terminated and the property is lost. I think that if youve got somebody sitting at a laptop at their kitchen table, doing what they would normally be doing in their office, the chances of the landlord clamping down on that are probably quite slim, he says. Once you get into the situation where people are doing something which is public-facing, with the result that customers start turning up at the property or the amount of traffic in the street increases, the business activity starts to become more visible, more intrusive. I think that is potentially a risk [for legal action]. Some people looking to buy or use a property as an Airbnb, and who had assumed they could rent it out on a short-term basis, have discovered this is not permitted. The leases for many flats often contain small print that, for example, might prevent them being let out for periods of less than six months. Renting them out despite these rules raises the risk of legal action. Some will either be unaware of this, or they may decide to go ahead and hope for the best. In the case of a block of flats, the freeholder may well be represented by a management company. Renting a flat out for a short period could violate clauses which restrict its use to a private residence only. The best advice in all cases is to check the lease and paperwork very carefully. If necessary, check with the landlord or management company or managing agent, and consider getting some legal advice.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"are-you-invested-in-2023\/2023\/feb\/17\/investment-bootcamp-five-ways-to-make-your-money-work-harder","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/are-you-invested-in-2023\/2023\/feb\/17\/investment-bootcamp-five-ways-to-make-your-money-work-harder","DATE":"2023-02-17 15:15:31","PLAIN_TEXT":"If youre thinking about investing for the first time, your instinct may be to delay transferring any surplus cash into the stock market until the economic environment is a little calmer. With inflation at a 40-year high, the cost of living crisis, and volatile financial markets, it may seem like a good idea to hold on to your cash. However, delaying investing may not be the smartest decision for your money. The timing of when you start investing is less important than how long you invest for, experts say, adding that ideally you should invest for a minimum of five years to help ride out peaks and troughs in stock markets. The challenge for new investors, particularly amid the current level of market volatility, is avoiding knee-jerk reactions, says Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, an investment platform. Bear in mind that, historically, money invested in shares generally produces higher returns than money in a savings account - over the long-term, at least. Nothing is guaranteed, of course. You may get back less money than you put in. Past financial performance is not a guide to future financial performance. So how can first-time investors adapt their investment strategy to the current volatile economic environment? Here are five things to consider when investing. Review your financesBefore you invest in anything, start by reviewing your personal finances. Try to pay off all high-interest debt such as credit cards or loans. According to research by PwC, the average UK household now has PS16,200 in unsecured debt such as loans, overdrafts and credit card borrowing. For indebted investors, any investment profit is unlikely to outstrip interest they pay on high-interest loans, says Jobson. After clearing debts, financial experts advise having a rainy day fund of between three and six months worth of income. This fund, ideally held in an easy-to-access savings account, covers essential living costs. It is handy if you lose your job, your income falls, or you are unable to work. Before starting to invest, review your finances and try to pay off any high-interest debt. Photograph: Tom WernerGetty Images Be clear about your investment aimsIt may sound like an obvious question, but its important to ask yourself why youre investing in the first place, says Jobson. Common investment aims include helping to fund a comfortable retirement, your wedding, or saving towards the cost of your childrens university fees. Related: From hidden costs to lack of knowledge: seven misconceptions that stop people from investing Do a risk assessmentYour investment timeframe will partly determine how much risk you are prepared to take with your money. If, say, you are in your 20s and are investing for a pension to fund your retirement, you will likely be prepared to take more risk than if you are five years away from retirement. That is because a young persons investments will have three decades or more to recoup any losses from fluctuations in financial markets. Typically, the bigger returns you want to make on your investment, the bigger risks youll need to take. If you have a very long-time horizon for investing, probably 10 years plus, you may be suited to more adventurous [investment] funds or shares, says Jobson. If youre more risk averse, or have a shorter investment timeframe, you might prefer a balanced fund, incorporating bonds as well as equities. This can help take some of the sting out of stock market volatility, says Jobson. Spread your moneyYoure probably familiar with the investment adage of not putting all your eggs (money) in one basket (type of investment). The downside is, the amount of choice can quickly become overwhelming - especially if you are new to investing. But you can diversify your investments through an investment fund that pools money from many investors and professionally manages a spread of investments on your behalf. To keep things simple, beginner investors often invest in a multi-asset fund. As the name suggests, these funds invest in a range of assets, mostly stocks and bonds, but also property and commodities such as gold. The funds are good one-stop shop solutions, says Jobson. Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor. Photograph: David Woolfall Photography Fund managers - expert investors - look after investors pooled money and decide where to invest it. You can essentially let them do all the hard work and diversify your investments for you, says Jobson. Some investment platforms have funds designed for beginner investors. Interactive Investor, for example, showcases the best-in-class quick-start funds. Invest little but often One way to lower your investment risks in economically volatile times is by investing little and often, says Jobson. This approach is known as pound cost averaging - drip-feeding money into investments, even during a downturn, to smooth out rises and falls in financial markets and, therefore, the value of your investments. When prices go up, your money will buy fewer shares. When prices drop, it will buy you more. Potential disadvantages of pound cost averaging include limiting your investment gains in a booming market because youre not investing as much at one time. Despite the current economic gloom, there are reasons for first-time investors to be cautiously optimistic. Online investment platforms mean that it is now easier than ever to invest and to educate yourself about investment. With the advent of the internet and online investment platforms, you can invest as little as PS25 a month, and with Interactive Investor you can invest monthly with no trading fees, says Jobson. You dont have to have a lot of money to invest. Just do it little by little. Make your move today at ii.co.uk The value of your investments may go down as well as up. You may not get back all the money that you invest. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. If you are unsure about the suitability of an investment product or service, please seek advice from an authorised financial advisor.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/08\/working-from-home-model-survive-energy-crisis-cost-of-living","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/08\/working-from-home-model-survive-energy-crisis-cost-of-living","DATE":"2022-09-08 05:00:08","PLAIN_TEXT":"After two years of global crisis, the genie is well and truly out of the bottle when it comes to work: employees in the UK no longer want the 9-to-5, bookended by an exhausting and expensive commute. Anecdotally, that might seem obvious. But having documented the changes to organisational life through the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the Work after Lockdown project (funded by the Economic and Social Research Council), what is significant about these findings is that this mindset shift appears to be permanent. Figures show nearly 40% of working adults in Great Britain are now working across multiple locations in a hybrid working model. However, as the energy crisis threatens to bite, there are warnings that this winters looming energy crisis could kill off our new working culture. So, which one is it? Amid the detailed calculations being made, one aspect is already clear: socio-economic circumstances will be a main driver in whether working from home remains firmly rooted in our way of life, and peoples decisions about work are still the product of their circumstances. One public sector graduate trainee told me that, by her calculations, the cost of train fares, coffees and snacks left her better off working from home. But if energy costs rise sharply, she will probably switch to travelling into the office over shouldering a punitively high heating bill. It is precisely this fluctuating picture that makes this winter so difficult to plan for. Another senior manager working for a London local authority told me that while some of her staff had indicated that they might want to be coming into the office more often in the coming months, there was a lack of concrete information or certainty. When we consider how working trends might be affected by the rising cost of living, the geographies of labour markets cannot be ignored. With the UK having some of the longest commutes in Europe, financial savings from reduced commuting were some of the most notable markers of lockdown delivering some measurable benefit to working people. And as train fares continue to outstrip inflation, organisations staffed by suburban commuters are likely to find employees continue to be more attached to working from home to save money, while those who live closer to offices may find the lure of a heated space outweighs the benefits of home working. Of course, these financial decisions are rarely made in isolation. In our research, we saw people adapt the quality of their workspace over the lockdowns, working in separate rooms where possible to prioritise privacy and maximise concentration. But as heating becomes more expensive, this looks less feasible, while merging home workspaces could provoke personal tensions, damage productivity and even have a disruptive effect upon family relationships. Related: A generation of Britons face long-term illness from being cold and poor this winter | Michael Marmot Peoples homes will also be a crucial factor in their decisions on where to work. One senior manager told me that they feel the Sam Vines Boots theory feels more relevant than ever in the public sector - that financial pressures are regressive, hitting poorer groups harder. Those with better insulated houses may be more able to absorb energy rises, and continue to enjoy the greater flexibility of hybrid working, while those in less maintained or rented accommodation might find working from home unaffordable, or unrealistic. This is an amplification of what we found in our lockdown research, that property resources were a key differentiator in working from home experiences. One young, inner-city employee told me that she has now shelved her plans to move out of shared accommodation. And as more and more people occupy shared spaces for financial reasons, this will no doubt have an impact on how appealing, or even possible, it is to work from home. Financial hardship could trigger movement towards workplaces to reduce travel costs, but as housing demand continues to outstrip supply in many areas, even in previously affordable parts of the country, rising energy bills and food costs could threaten to push working people towards homelessness. Inevitably, lower-paid, but key, sectors of the labour market are at a greater risk of these negative outcomes. Parents, too, face complicated decisions. The UK already has the most expensive childcare in Europe, and, for many, working from home has enabled them to save costs on the wrap-around care that they previously needed to cover travel time. This winter, for some, this situation may no longer represent a saving, and the extra cost of childcare will need to be balanced against rising heating bills. The unavoidable losses here will be to family life. There is much to concern us as we look ahead to winter. Businesses will have to prioritise skilled diversity management to support the different circumstances evolving around office presence, as well as the stresses that staff find themselves working through during a time of crisis. Offices may become staffed, temporarily at least, by proportionately more younger people and lower-paid workers, which could usher in culture changes around visibility and progression at work. But we must be cautious not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Working from home boosted individual productivity - an unexpected gain for employers. Even before the energy crisis, office occupancy was no longer being prioritised by any of our case study organisations after the pandemic. This is a huge shift in UK working culture that we could not have predicted would have occurred so rapidly. However desperate it might feel, this looming crisis, if managed correctly, could offer an opportunity to capitalise on the working gains that the pandemic kickstarted. It will be just as crucial that businesses work out when they need office space, as it will be for employees to calculate how their working patterns can help them weather the energy crisis. If the pandemic has taught us anything about our changing work culture, its that agility should not be underestimated in the face of ever more complicated and unpredictable scenarios. Offices are entering the next period of change, with two new resources to hand: an infinitely more flexible workforce than in 2019, and an enhanced appreciation of the connection between wellbeing and productivity. Now is the time to protect these hard-won gains that have persisted so far despite the most extraordinary of circumstances. Giving up on working from home would be to lose a valuable weapon in our arsenal needed to weather this latest storm, and the ones to come.

This a question that appears to trouble the Tory grandee Jacob Rees-Mogg and his staff. But then, the former business secretary has long been on a campaign against public sector employees working from home. In April, he left notes on the desk of civil servants who were not in the office. More recently, he described working from home as second best. Rees-Moggs views about working from home may seem anachronistic, but they reflect a wider culture of in-personism. Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has demanded staff return to the office and work long hours there. Alan Sugar has deemed home workers to be lazy layabouts. Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, which recently bought the messaging service Slack, worries that the rise of remote working means his companys employees are not building tribal knowledge with new employees. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, claims remote working doesnt work for people who want to hustle. A recent survey by Microsoft found that 85% of managers said they struggled to have confidence that their employees were being productive when working from home. Newspapers such as the Daily Mail run endless coverage on why the UK must get back to the office, denigrating woke workplaces that give staff flexible working arrangements and declaring Britain the global leader in refusing to return to work culture. A Telegraph column last week praised the grafters of this great nation who journey to the office undaunted by any obstacle - including trustafarians who think nothing of gluing themselves to the M25 during rush hour. Of all the targets identified by the rights culture war, here is a new one: you, with a laptop in the kitchen. The former prime minister Boris Johnson was also at the vanguard of the war against wfh, saying that a return to the workplace would boost productivity. But what was the evidence for that? Indeed, much of the evidence points in the other direction. Continuing research led by Stanford Universitys Nicholas Bloom suggests that allowing employees to work from home a few days a week has significant benefits - including an increase in productivity if hybrid working is well organised. A chronic problem faced by the public sector - and indeed large parts of the British economy - is poor productivity. Rates of productivity in the UK economy have been flat for over a decade. A study by researchers at the University of Manchester found that public sector productivity had only improved by an average of 0.7% per year from 2010-2019. Economists have pointed out that productivity can be improved through a range of interventions including more spending on research and development, better infrastructure, improving skills and better quality management . One way to boost productivity is by allowing employees to work from home. And while it is true that managers who make decisions about home working tend to underestimate the gains to productivity that can come from home working policies, and workers are likely to overestimate the gains , overall, studies show that for suitable jobs, productivity can increase when working from home. Home working can bring other benefits to the economy. Lets start with pay. Currently many parts of the UK public sector are impacted by strikes as workers demand pay rises so their wages keep pace with inflation. While a decent pay packet is certainly vital, there are situations where workers are willing to trade off slightly lower pay for better conditions. This seems to be the case with working from home - if, of course, it is practical to do so. Blooms team at Stanford University found that people in the public sector said that the ability to work from home two or three days a week was equivalent to a 6.7% pay rise. That number is over 10% in the finance and technology sectors. One reason for this is that working for home reduces costs such as commuting and childcare. But working from home a few days a week also improves peoples quality of life - and this is something they are willing to pay for. This suggests that allowing people to work from home a few days a week may go some way towards making up for shrinking real wages. Giving people the chance to work from home can also help with retention. Despite what the founder of the Phones 4u chain, John Caudwell, says is a growing sense of entitlement on the part of workers who think jobs exist for their own convenience rather than to serve customers or the public, offering home working a few days a week can help employers to hang on to the people they have. Blooms survey found that a typical hybrid working policy reduced quit-rates by 35%. Many parts of the workforce are struggling with endemic staff shortages. While the chronic vacancies afflicting the NHS and social care, the restaurant sector, the arts and the high street need in-person staff, there are many other jobs where the UK is struggling to recruit people that could build in home working as an option - from engineering to technology. Many employers are spending money on initiatives such as free food and lunchtime mindfulness classes to try to entice staff back to the office and make them happier. There is little evidence that this works. Blooms research has found that employees generally report being happier, though, when they are able to work from home some of the time. Rees-Mogg and his outriders may think that attacking home working is a good way to keep voters on side. However, according to one study from Kings College London, 66% of London workers who voted Conservative thought it was unacceptable for politicians to claim that people who worked at home were less hardworking. Where Rees-Mogg is right is that requiring many employees to be in the office at least some of the time is a good idea. Having a few days a week when employees are in the office gives people the opportunity to interact, collaborate and build their networks. Also it gives younger employees an opportunity to learn from their more experienced colleagues. Indeed, Blooms research suggests that working practices seem to have settled on a new norm of people spending on average two days a week working from home. The added benefit is that for many of us being in the office is cheaper than putting the heating on. While some Tory politicians are clearly seeking to make working from home into a culture war, surely they should be leaving companies and people to sort this out for themselves. Where will this end? Will it be where JRM and the wfh culture warriors would wish? Two days a week, three days a week: shouldnt it be wherever millions of companies and their employees decide is most likely to make their lives and enterprises simultaneously profitable? They may see an opportunity, even if Rees-Mogg and others do not.

Cuts to public transport and the high cost of fares act as a major deterrent to workers making daily trips to the office, while traffic jams and the soaring cost of petrol and diesel, which hit a fresh peak this week, make commuting by car unattractive, the survey found. Only 10% of the workers said they thought they would return to the office full-time compared with 73% who told researchers from Kings College London that working from home at least one day a week would be a permanent feature of modern life. Related: Out of office? How working from home has divided Britain Old and young respondents gave the same positive response to working from home, as did those who vote Labour and Conservative, though a larger number of Labour than Tory supporters was in favour of home working. Tara Reich, an expert in human resource management at Kings College business school, said: The opportunity to work from home has given many London workers a sense of control that they arent keen to give up. Among those who say they experienced positive impacts from working at home, avoiding the daily commute was seen as the top benefit by 80%, followed by the ability to manage home-social responsibilities on 66% - with 71% of women citing this as a factor compared with 60% of men. The report is expected to alarm the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and Transport for London executives, who need people to return to previous levels of commuting from next year, when the government plans to make the capitals transport system self-financing. Other cities, where workers are likely to take a similarly positive view of home working, are also likely to see the results as a blow to revitalising central shopping districts and plans by tram, bus and train operators to reinstate more frequent services. Many employers have reported that staff prefer to work from Tuesday to Thursday in the office and have reported a resistance to a return to pre-pandemic levels of office working. Amanda Jones, a lecturer in organisational behaviour at the business school, said: Many more people now have experience of working remotely, while organisations and individuals have invested heavily in equipment and training, and those forced to work remotely during the lockdowns have developed remote-working strategies.

The only concern the respondents revealed in the survey was towards younger workers, who around half believed would miss out on career opportunities and vital work experience. The survey of 2,001 people in work found that 56% believe senior management want staff to come into the workplace more often while only 16% said managers approved of home working.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/jul\/14\/frasers-group-scraps-friday-home-working","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/jul\/14\/frasers-group-scraps-friday-home-working","DATE":"2022-07-14 17:41:53","PLAIN_TEXT":"Mike Ashleys Frasers Group has banned staff from working from home on Fridays after claiming social media posts showed they were relaxing during working time. The retailer, which owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, has asked staff to be in the office all week, ending a flexible working policy introduced during the pandemic. An internal memo, sent by the companys chief operating officer, said Frasers Friday had become an unproductive day of the week, according to a report in the Sun. David Al-Mudallal reportedly wrote in the memo too many examples of people or teams not being contactable when they need to be ... and colleagues who via their social media profiles are demonstrating theyre not treating Friday as a working day. The Frasers Friday policy was introduced at the end of 2020 as government edicts to limit the spread of Covid-19 forced millions of people to work from home. The company - which employs over 25,000 people across its stores and two head office locations in Oxford Street, London and Shirebrook, Derbyshire - is understood to have unwound the new way of working after monitoring productivity and reaching the conclusion that office attendance was more effective. A Frasers Group spokesperson said: We have an incredible workforce of dedicated colleagues, and in-person collaboration is key to how we deliver value together. We believe that we are all at our best when we work together in an office environment. The retail groups insistence on office working comes as the government tries to force civil servants back to their desks and city centre businesses and transport networks struggle to cope with lower commuter numbers.

Almost a third of the UKs office-based workforce are still working from home at least part of the time, according to the ONS.

Six in 10 employees are considering changing their job this year, according to data gathered by the professional networking site LinkedIn, although one in five of that group said they would remain in their current role if they continued to be able to work remotely, or more flexibly. Women are particularly keen on more workplace flexibility, and more than half (52%) reported they had left or were considering leaving their job because of a lack of flexibility, according to the research, which combined LinkedIn data with the results of multiple worker surveys. Related: Life has sprinkled magic on me: Venice entices remote workers to reverse exodus of youth The responses by workers are seen as further evidence that employers will need to continue to offer flexibility to their workforce in order to recruit and retain staff, especially during a tight labour market. Thursday next week marks three years since the beginning of the first UK lockdown, which brought with it an immediate move to home working for many previously office-based workers. The majority of employers adopted a hybrid model, even as Covid rules were eased, with workers splitting their time between their desks and home or another location. However, the research indicates the share of job postings for remote roles has shrunk for the past 10 months, declining to almost 11% of the UK total - a 30% fall compared with a year earlier. LinkedIn found that demand for remote roles was outstripping supply in the UK, with remote roles receiving more than a fifth (22%) of job applications in February. Yet almost half (49%) of company leaders in the UK and abroad have said they would prefer their employees to work more frequently from the office. In February, US workers at the online retailer Amazon criticised the move by the companys chief executive to ask them and their colleagues around the world to return to the office for the majority of the working week, or at least three days. Andy Jassy wrote in a staff memo: Collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when were in person. He added that it was easier for workers to learn from each other, and feel more connected to their colleagues, when sharing the same workspace. Amazon is not alone: LinkedIn found in late 2022 that almost a third (32%) of companies were looking to cut back on allowing employees to work from home. Ngaire Moyes, LinkedIns country manager for the UK, said many workers did not want life to return to how it was before Covid. We know that flexibility brings all sorts of benefits - including being a huge motivator for employees - meaning its crucial for employers to consider this when it comes to attracting top talent, she said. However, it also creates a level of complexity for leaders. Socialising with colleagues may be one further motivation for workers to visit the office more frequently. Almost a third (30%) of UK employees said they wanted to make more effort with their colleagues this year, while a similar figure said they planned to go to their workplace more frequently.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"environment\/2021\/aug\/02\/is-remote-working-better-for-the-environment-not-necessarily","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2021\/aug\/02\/is-remote-working-better-for-the-environment-not-necessarily","DATE":"2021-08-02 15:00:30","PLAIN_TEXT":"Stacy Kauk was finalizing Shopifys 2019 sustainability report when the pandemic forced the company into remote work. I kind of stopped in my footsteps and went, Uh oh, whats going to happen if were closing our offices during Covid and staying remote in the long term? What does that mean for Shopifys corporate carbon footprint? said Kauk, who directs the Canadian e-commerce companys $5m annual sustainability fund. Related: Why is a big oil company investing huge amounts of money in Wyoming wind? Its a vital question that companies may need to ask as they start to redefine their working models in the wake of the pandemic - though sustainability experts worry that not all will. For the roughly 20% to 40% of employees who can work from home, many companies are announcing that post-pandemic work wont necessarily take place at work - at least not five days a week. Microsoft, Spotify, Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Nationwide insurance, Capital One and Citigroup, among others, have embraced hybrid configurations combining remote work and time in the office. There soon could be four times as many people working from home as did pre-Covid. Theres an intuitive assumption - encouraged by lockdown memories of rush-hour quiet and dissipated smog - that remote work is de facto better for the environment. But its not yet clear how radically shifting the way business is done will alter the climate impacts of doing business. Shopifys headquarters in Ottawa, Canada. The software company is in the process of analyzing the climate impacts of long-term remote working. Photograph: Paul McKinnonAlamy Stock Photo Rare moment to reset work Shopifys CEO declared in May of last year that remote work would become a permanent fixture. Accounting for the energy consumption of its nearly 6,000 employees working from home in 2020, Shopifys emissions dropped 29%, according to Kauk. But last year isnt typical remote work, she said. Its remote work during Covid. What happens when the world opens back up? Kauk posed the dilemma to Watershed, a software outfit that helps companies track and reduce their carbon footprints. Now that were going back to work, its this rare once-a-decade reset moment when companies can redefine their working model and do it with an eye on carbon, said Taylor Francis. The punchline is that its more complicated than meets the eye. Take commuting. Transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and more than half come from personal vehicles. Close to 90% of people drive to work - usually alone - and the daily back and forth accounts for nearly 30% of the miles American workers drive in a year. Doing away with millions of workers daily commutes seems like an easy climate win. Carbon dioxide emissions from transportation dropped 15% last year as people hunkered at home. Early rush hour traffic rolls along I-10 in Phoenix. Remote working will save emissions from daily commutes. Photograph: Ross D FranklinAP When workers homes become their offices, commutes may fall out of the carbon equation, but whats happening inside those homes must be added in. How much energy is being used to run the air conditioner or heater? Is that energy coming from clean sources? In some parts of the country during lockdown, average home electricity consumption rose more than 20% on weekdays, according to the International Energy Agency. IEAs analysis suggests workers who use public transport or drive less than four miles each way could actually increase their total emissions by working from home. Looking further ahead, the questions multiply. Many Shopify employees live near the office and walk, bike or take public transit. Will remote work mean they move from city apartments to sprawling suburban homes, which use, on average, three times more energy? Will they buy cars? Will they be electric or gas-powered SUVs? You have company control over what takes place in the office, Kauk noted. When you have everyone working remotely from home, corporate discretion is now employee discretion. Theres also the question of flying. While business travel is still down about 70%, most business leaders expect it to return to pre-pandemic levels. Francis is concerned that companies with distributed workforces will more than make up for saved daily commuting emissions by flying in staff for quarterly gatherings. One round-trip flight from Chicago to Los Angeles releases nearly as much CO2 as three months of a 10-mile driving commute. Kauk said Shopify will incorporate the emissions data it collects into planning employee gatherings. Hidden climate impacts Letting workers who can work remotely split their time between home and office is emerging as the dominant choice for companies navigating the new normal. But hybrid working could create a worst-case scenario, according to a June study from the Carbon Trust and Vodafone Institute for Society and Communications. This split could result in consuming more energy and emitting more emissions as both homes and offices are fully operating to enable teleworkers and office workers to do their jobs, the report warned. Watersheds modeling suggests the same. This kind of hybrid world isnt quite as good as everyone thinks, said Francis. I see a lot of companies unwittingly creating a higher-carbon workplace than the one they had before Covid. He added: I think they are well-intentioned, but unfortunately common sense is not the same thing as carbon math. Reducing office footprints can reduce carbon footprints, but that, too, comes with caveats. To achieve a hybrid model, companies are closing offices or redesigning them to accommodate fewer workers: Nearly three-quarters of Fortune 500 CEOs expect to downsize office space post-pandemic. But many executives may fail to consider the climate cost of downsizing, said Trevor Langdon, president of environmental firm Green Standards. Furniture waste is frequently overlooked, said Langdon, even by companies that track sustainability efforts. They might be reporting on things like energy consumption, and reduction in paper waste or food waste in their cafeteria, but when they close or renovate their offices, a dozen floors of furniture go rolling out the back door into the landfill and nobody is capturing that environmental impact. When Hootsuite redesigned its Vancouver office earlier this year, Green Standards says it kept 19 tons of material out of landfill, recycling 20% and donating the rest to local non-profits. The firm offers a resale platform so employees can buy decommissioned office equipment for their home work spaces, such as monitors and $1,000 desk chairs that go for a few hundred dollars. Managing how employees work is ultimately a small part of the equation when it comes to curbing corporate emissions and achieving net-zero goals, said Maria Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition. But she sees positives in the way businesses were able to drastically shift mindset during the pandemic and reinvent how they operated in a matter of months. It proves how resilient they are to major shocks, she said, and theyll need to be as the climate crisis worsens: Its an incredible lesson. Francis hopes all companies realize the potential for positive change. I think theres a real risk that companies miss the boat on what could be a really important moment to bend the carbon curve over the long term, he said. * This article was amended on 6 August 2021 to correct a misspelling of Trevor Langdons surname.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/may\/15\/remote-working-uk-equal-jacob-rees-mogg","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/may\/15\/remote-working-uk-equal-jacob-rees-mogg","DATE":"2022-05-15 12:50:40","PLAIN_TEXT":"In the shadow of the old Spode pottery works, in Stoke-on-Trent, something is stirring. Royals once dined off the fine china plates manufactured here, but the factory itself closed well over a decade ago, when its parent company went bust in the banking crash. Now, where it once stood, a very different way of working is taking shape. The Potbank site includes a cafe, a hotel and flexible office spaces built for a more rootless, hot-desking, post-pandemic culture emerging as the world of work changes to embrace working from home, according to Jeff Nash, director of the company that owns the scheme. There is ambitious talk of filling the grand old town halls and listed warehouses left over from the areas glory days with hi-tech startups with much more flexible working cultures: video game designers, AI and robotics firms whose processes are transforming the ceramics still made here. Silicon Stoke is wooing creative media graduates from the towns own university, but also young artists seeking cheap overheads and the kind of quirky, gritty, post-industrial vibe that cities like Manchester had 30 years ago. Unlike those who used to clock on at the Spode factory, with fast enough broadband they can work from anywhere: why pay a fortune to live in the gentrified big city? This story doesnt fit stale cliches about red wall towns, and still less does it fit the prime ministers stubborn insistence on everyone returning to a conventional office. But it helps explain why Stoke - where the cabinet held an awayday last week - is Britains third biggest growth area for remote and flexible jobs, according to a study led by the recruiters Indeed and video conferencing platform Zoom, which should turn lazy political arguments on their heads. Their league table of post-pandemic Zoom towns - places where adverts for jobs that can be worked flexibly or at least partly from home have more than trebled since 2020 - found 10 out of 25 overlapped with red-wall areas, with Tory-held Stoke and Burnley beaten only by the seaside town of Worthing. So much for home working being a middle-class remainer cult, as the Telegraph declared, for people who spent lockdown buying puppies and Pelotons. When Boris Johnson says that in his experience home working involves too much walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese and then forgetting what you were actually doing; or Jacob Rees-Mogg tours Whitehall offices leaving pointed sorry you were out when I visited messages at empty desks, the message is that ordinary workers dont have such perks, and neither should a hated elite. This isnt levelling up but punching up, stoking envy instead of figuring out how everyone can enjoy a happier working life - which in jobs that cant be done from home may mean other forms of flexibility instead, such as part-time hours or the small changes that make family life possible. But its also flatly at odds with reality. The Office for National Statistics predicts that 57% of workers will work at least partly from home by this autumn, while two-thirds of Britons already work flexibly in some way. The world is moving on regardless of politicians shouting into the wind, and while the owners of fast-emptying glass towers in the City may be dismayed, in places such as Stoke and Barnsley and Middlesbrough, its potentially revolutionary. What sucks the life from smaller towns is young people moving away for better jobs. But would more choose to stay close to their roots, in places where houses are still cheap and they have family nearby to help with the kids, if remote working for at least part of the week let them tap into big-city opportunities without having to up sticks? More home working means less commuting, putting money back into hard-pressed pockets; it breathes life back into struggling local high streets too, drawing new people in. In Grimsby, the tech entrepreneur Jason Stockwood - who was born in the town and recently bought its football club - has a vision for turning the place into a pool of expert digital remote workers, capable of taking jobs in London without having to actually live there. Across the Humber estuary, Hull is rebranding itself as the capital of co-working hubs - places where remote workers can hire desk space and congregate for a bit of creative inspiration. For office life is not dead yet. Rees-Mogg is right that people still need to bounce ideas off each other, learn from more experienced colleagues, and indeed just get out of the house. But they dont need to be there five days a week to do it, which is why a hybrid working week is becoming the new norm. CEOs like the savings on office costs (did nobody tell Rees-Mogg that desks are empty because Whitehall has been encouraging civil servants to work from home for a decade to save money?), and the chance to hire beyond the shrinking pool of people who can afford to move to London. Related: Who should be prime minister? Anyone but Boris Johnson | Max Hastings Beneath the skin of politics, where nobody can see it, there is some practical thinking going on. Next month the Tory thinktank Onward will host a panel event with the small-business minister, Paul Scully, on how remote working could help red-wall economies grow. Matt Warman, the Tory MP and former digital minister, has just begun a review of the future of work commissioned by Downing Street, which will consider how remote working could change the way Britons feel about where we live. In private many Tories sympathise with the reported view of the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, that counting bums on office seats has a whiff of something Dickensian about it: why not measure what people actually do, rather than where theyre sitting? And Stokes renaissance has undoubtedly relied on government levelling-up funds and money for fast broadband. Yet, in its public messaging at least, the supposed party of business lags behind business itself. Proposals to expand flexible working were ditched from last weeks Queens speech, while Rees-Mogg harrumphs about how working from home on a Monday or Friday indicates not a serious attitude to work. This is the toxic politics of nostalgia, fetishising the past at the expense of those whose lives could be transformed by moving on. Remote working isnt a magic bullet to solve the red walls ills; and, like all big economic shifts, this one will have winners and losers. But thats all the more reason for ministers to stop fighting change and start shaping it for the public good. For, as all post-industrial towns know, if you dont go out and meet the future, eventually it simply moves on without you.

The citys population has dropped by more than 123,000 in the last decade, with many leaving in search of cheaper housing and green spaces, according to official figures. Frances statistics agency, Insee, says Paris is losing about 12,400 people a year and the city population - now at about 2.1 million - is at its lowest for 20 years. The Covid pandemic and lockdowns are seen as a factor but the cost of housing is a key motivation: the average a square metre is about EUR10,000. Many of those who have left the capital have moved further out in the Ile-de-France region - that includes Paris - whose population is 12.4 million and where property and rents are more affordable. Departures from the capital are motivated in particular by the high cost of housing, the reduced supply of large housing for family and the search for a different living environment, Insee reported. While attracting young professionals in the mould of the title character of the Netflix romantic comedy Emily in Paris, the capital, one of the most densely populated in the world, has been accused of ignoring its own population. With limited space to build new homes, the deputy mayor, Emmanuel Gregoire, says the only ways for the city authorities and government to take proactive measures include: buying up buildings and forcing the owners of large offices to set aside space for controlled rent public housing; strict controls on holiday rentals; and increasing taxes on holiday homes - a measure it has so far been reluctant to introduce. Emmanuel Gregoire says Paris welcomes tourists but we prefer that when visitors come here they stay in hotels not apartments. Photograph: Marechal AuroreABACARexShutterstock Paris already requires Airbnb owners to register their property and limits the number of nights they can rent to tourists. People using property for tourism and second homes aggravate the pressure on the available housing. We dont want apartments dedicated to tourist rentals. We understand it can be a complementary income for people but the main role of an apartment should be as housing for local people, Gregoire explained. Paris welcomes tourists but we prefer that when visitors come here they stay in hotels not apartments. We would like the government to introduce stricter rules. It would be abhorrent to stop foreigners buying property in Paris. What we want is Paris full of people who live in Paris and taxation is the way to do this and put off investors. We have to discourage people who say, I have watched Emily in Paris Ill buy a pied-a-terre there, with a secondary residence surtax of 60%. Emily in Paris is great for stimulating tourism in Paris but we want people living here as permanent residents. If they want to visit they can stay with friends or in hotels. In last years presidential election, the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, accused the government of hitting the middle classes by abolishing the taxe dhabitation, a local council tax, the only means local authorities had to raise money. Second-home owners are still required to pay this tax and Gregoire says city hall wants the government to impose a further 60% increase on another tax paid by property owners. In November, city hall, which aims to have 40% public housing by 2035, presented a plan - expected to be passed in April - to adapt existing buildings to produce thousands of low rent and affordable housing by converting offices, garages, hotels and imposing social housing in new construction projects or major renovations. Despite the citys huge debt of EUR8bn (PS7bn) - compared with EUR1bn in 2001 - he says the money will be found because letting market forces control the availability of property in the capital would destroy the city, leaving it full of offices, holiday homes and the very wealthy. We want a city where those who sweep the streets and those who care for people, the nurses and home helps, can afford to live here, Gregoire said. Ian Brossat, responsible for housing at city hall, said it was determined to counteract property speculation. We want to protect as many Parisians as possible from real estate speculation, he told Le Monde. And to ensure that those who work in Paris can live there since the city loses residents every year because they can no longer afford to stay. Nelly Garnier, an opposition Paris councillor, told BFMTV that city hall was in denial about the real problems. I talk to Parisians and they are disgusted ... Paris was always the place you wanted to come to so you could live your dreams, now its a confused city. We are angry with Anne Hidalgo and her green [coalition] allies turning it into a city people want to flee. They have degraded life in Paris. Gregoire says a falling population should not be seen as something good or bad and that the causes need examining. The ideal population is about 2.1 million. Its a complex situation and there are lots of factors we have to understand to know how we can react and correct what is happening. It would be wrong to say people are leaving because Paris is ugly and dirty.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/dec\/04\/new-love-affair-with-office-step-towards-better-philosophy-of-work","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/dec\/04\/new-love-affair-with-office-step-towards-better-philosophy-of-work","DATE":"2022-12-04 07:00:07","PLAIN_TEXT":"Our love affair with working from home, triggered during Covid lockdowns by the often cheerless embrace of Zoom, is cooling sharply. The daily commute is becoming fashionable, especially if you are young. The alternative is experienced by too many as lonely, isolating, distracting, threatening to ones mental health, polluting of ones home space. Its expensive to keep warm - and youre often the last to find out whats going on among your colleagues. Workplaces, after all, are where you make friends and sometimes meet life partners, as well as learn all that tacit knowledge so crucial to doing your job well and so build your career. We humans are social animals and creating working lives permanently apart from others was always going against the grain. Figures from Transport for London (TfL) confirm what we already know from TikTok, where sharing workplace highlights among Gen Zers is among the new viral memes. Its fun and refreshing to be at work with other people. Last Thursday saw the highest London Underground usage since the start of the pandemic, with 3.64m journeys. Tube usage is climbing to between 75% and 80% of pre-pandemic levels, up from 45% in January - while buses are even more popular. TfL says passenger levels on some bus routes in outer London are back to pre-pandemic levels. The signs are that it is the young who are readier to re-enter the world of nine to five. Weekday cycling in London is up 25% on pre-pandemic levels - commuter cycling is mostly undertaken by the young and early middle aged. Another straw in the wind is that a third of all journeys are now paid for by contactless mobile phone devices, says TfL, again most likely to be used by the young - higher than pre-pandemic levels. On current trends, by next summer or early autumn Londons overall commuter traffic will be very close to or above pre-pandemic levels. Its a similar trend around the country . Stories abound of young people moving jobs not because they want to work from home, but because they want to work in workplaces populated by other staff. Better that than the mounting bleakness of commuting alone from your bedroom to the kitchen table day after day and living a sterile online life, a major source of depression during Covid lockdowns. A number of people I know have switched jobs largely for this reason. Others who are forced to work from home choose to do so in collective workspaces, just to get out of their house or flat regularly and share a coffee. The message is beginning to be taken on board by employers. Consultants Timewise reported in its annual Flexible Jobs Index for 2022 last week that only 12% of the 6m job adverts they analysed in the first half of the year allow for some form of hybrid working. This should not be a surprise. It is less an obsession with presenteeism that drives employers to want to see their employees physically at work and more that they understand the importance of tacit knowledge and that most work is delivered by teams rather than by individuals. Teams work best with lots of face time and shared purpose - all best framed by being in the same physical workplace at the same time. Try building a great team whose continuity is permanently challenged by members working remotely. It can be done, but its not easy. Teams work best with lots of face time and shared purpose, all best framed by being in the same physical workplace But employers such as Twitters new boss, Elon Musk, who insisted his workforce come to work Monday through Friday, are only partly right. For alongside this desire to work beyond the home, there is a strong demand, learned from lockdowns, for more ability to vary where and when we work. Beware - the workplace is in flux. As Timewise also reports, nine out of 10 workers want to vary their hours, but only half are able to do so. As ever in contemporary Britain, there is the long shadow of inequality. It is those with greater skills who are best able to exploit the new shared understanding that some work in any week can be done from home effectively at the same time as very few want to work at home full time. What is emerging is a new class of privileged workers in privileged sectors - finance, business services, consultancy, academia, parts of the media - who can insist on working from home part of the week, with Friday and Monday especially favoured to create a long weekend. Others who work in the foundation economy - shops, hospitals, cafes, petrol stations - where presence comes with the territory, have less hybridity, as do the unskilled with low-paid, flexible part-time work imposed on them - fewer hours than they want but with little flexibility over when to work them. Where will it end? The workplace and office are not about to die, nor last rites to be delivered to commuting - some of the wilder claims made during the lockdowns. My own guess is the evolving norm will be a three- to four-day, workplace-based working week, with some flexible hours added on, unless the government decides to impose common standards for us all, the privileged sectors taking the lead. As that becomes the standard-setting culture, even the disadvantaged parts of the labour market will do what they can to follow suit, but slowly and unevenly. It is a moment for a rejuvenated trade unionism to make its appeal. There is every chance of work starting to become happier and more built around the arc of our lives, with more hybridity for those with young families and less for those starting out or rejoining work who dont really want or need to stay at home. The future will be neither the Gradgrind of Musk, nor the confines of the front room. Rather, it will be an opportunity to reclaim work not as an act of alienation or exploitation but as something integral to our lives. As economists wring their hands over stagnating productivity, society is stumbling towards finding part of the answer: organising work so we can freely give of our best. Its a trend the government should buttress so it extends beyond the advantaged and privileged as far as possible to all, but its a ray of optimism in dark times. * Will Hutton is an Observer columnist","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2023\/jan\/25\/the-one-change-that-didnt-work-my-radical-decluttering-turned-into-terrible-regret","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2023\/jan\/25\/the-one-change-that-didnt-work-my-radical-decluttering-turned-into-terrible-regret","DATE":"2023-01-25 14:00:23","PLAIN_TEXT":"I saw the wooden trike in a charity shop window, sometime around 2017: it was a bit like seeing a once-beloved ex on a dating website. You didnt necessarily want them, but you didnt want anyone else to snap them up either. The trike had belonged to my daughter, and I was in the throes of decluttering my house - throwing other peoples things out, I had found, was easier than my own. I bought the trike back, and for weeks I staked out the other charity shops that had been given my castoffs in the hope I could reclaim books, jumpers, a small colander ... Some came back to me, but most didnt. Like many people, I read Marie Kondos bestselling book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying, and embraced radical decluttering as a way to improve myself. I threw out decades of detritus - payslips saved from my first job, CDs, reams of old magazines. About half went unmissed, but the rest has been largely regretted, including clothes, books and many random items I turned out to be quite sentimental about. The books I kept, which now fit on one bookshelf, are all impressive, truly self-improving works that everyone should probably read. Ive still not read them and almost certainly never will. That bookshelf reminds me of my failure. Tidying my house didnt change my life. It improved it in some ways (I still use Kondos folding techniques), but made it worse in others; I am irritated each time Ive had to buy a replacement vegetable peelerscrewdriverballpoint pen.

The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) has partnered with Prof Peter Corke, a robotics expert, to develop a shortlist of new technologies that could improve safety and scientific research on the continent. This process also has a strategic motivation; the federal government has a 10-year plan to boost its presence in the 42% of Antarctica where Australia has a historical territorial claim. Related: Australian team sets off on Antarctica mission to drill for oldest ice core ever obtained Antarctica is where the impacts of climate change are very strong and very easy to discern, so it is important to study the changes in this environment, said Corke, who is a researcher at Queensland University of Technology. But doing this work in Antarctica is just incredibly challenging. Its very cold. Its very windy. Its very remote. Getting people to do this type of work is expensive and theres an element of risk. Sign up for Guardian Australias free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Corke, who has developed prototypes used at the International Space Station, spent three months with AAD scientists in Hobart researching opportunities for robots. His report has now been presented to the federal government. The division is already using robots to study remote Adelie penguin colonies and to map the ocean floor. Corkes proposals include autonomous vehicles that could service remote campsites. You can imagine a smallish robot - smaller than a regular passenger car - that can tow a sled without a driver. You just tell it where to go and it will do its thing and then come back to you, Corke said. The problem is that when humans do something like this, you cant just have one person out there for safety reasons. There has to be two people at least. And then if something goes wrong, a search and rescue team need to be deployed. Adelie penguins off the east Antarctic coast, near the AADs Mawson research station. Photograph: Australian Antarctic Division Brett Chatwood, a manager in the AADs technology and innovation branch, said work had already started on using robots to monitor whale populations in the Southern Ocean. We are looking at collaborating with international partners to develop the ability to deploy tagging devices from drones and to take biopsies of whales, Chatwood said. At the moment, that work is done by putting scientists into small boats in the Southern Ocean and trying to get close enough to have that interaction with the whales. From a safety point of view, doing that work with a drone is going to be a lot safer for our people and less disruptive for the animals. The federal governments 10-year plan set aside $109m for the development of a new drone fleet, autonomous vehicles and medium lift helicopters. Chatwood said long-range drones would be tested from the research vessel Nuyina, once it returns from repair work. Related: Australian scientists observe rapid decline in Adelie penguin numbers off Antarctic coast The drone itself is a bus. Its a bus that allows us to take sensors to places that we have not been able to take them before, either off a research vessel or stations or field camps, he said. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the development of robotics was vital to ensuring Australias environmental record in Antarctica. Australias science in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean provides a window into past and present climate that helps informs us about the extent and consequences of climate change, Plibersek said. Academia and industry are working together to develop and adapt robotic technologies for the harsh Antarctic environment in the delivery of globally important climate and ecosystem science. Corke said many of the technologies needed already exist, but must be strengthened to survive in the harsh Antarctic climate.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/15\/long-covid-is-keeping-millions-out-of-work-and-worsening-our-labor-shortage","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/15\/long-covid-is-keeping-millions-out-of-work-and-worsening-our-labor-shortage","DATE":"2022-09-15 10:13:43","PLAIN_TEXT":"Weve all seen the headlines about labor shortages, worker attrition, or - as many mainstream media outlets refer to it - the Great Resignation. Its true: since 2020, a record number of people have quit their jobs. The trend is ongoing, and some argue quitting is contagious. But, theres another contagion thats probably causing people to leave the workforce in droves. Since 2020, there have been more than 95m recorded US Covid-19 cases, 1 million deaths and ongoing reports of Covid-induced chronic illness and disability, known as long Covid. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that long Covid affects one in five people infected with Sars-CoV-2. A recent Brookings Institution analysis found that as many as 2 to 4 million people may be out of work as a result. With more than 11m US jobs vacant, its plausible that up to one-third of current labor shortages are due to long Covid. In other words, the Great Resignation may be a symptom of a mass disabling event. So, why arent we talking more about quitting and long Covid? Instead of investigating the impact of continuing pandemic harms on the workforce, many have been quick to frame the Great Resignation through stories of white-collar workers seeking better work-life balance. For a society supposedly eager to move on from the pandemic, long Covid is an inconvenient truth. Its potential impact on the workforce is even more inconvenient, since governments frequently cite economic trouble as justification for dropping Covid-19 mitigation efforts. Despite a widespread media focus on white-collar workers who have quit, pandemic worker attrition is most obvious in essential industries that require in-person work. Many states face drastic teacher shortages and healthcare workers continue to quit. The restaurant and food service industry still experiences severe pandemic-related labor shortages today. These workers faced higher rates of infection than those working remotely, and probably experience higher rates of long Covid - both because preventing infection is the only way to prevent long Covid and because reinfection may increase risk. It stands to reason that long Covid may be driving shortages in these industries. A 2021 study by scientists at the University of California San Francisco indicated that line cooks faced the highest risk of mortality from Covid-19. One in five educators are long-haulers, and healthcare workers with long Covid say workplace pressures make it difficult to retain employment. As two people personally affected by post-viral illnesses, we understand the difficult choices facing long-haulers who cant survive financially without working. We both rely on remote work and flexible schedules to manage our health - privileges many with long Covid lack. Our symptoms are also milder than many, allowing us to work at all. More severely sick long-haulers face major barriers accessing social security disability benefits. Those who do qualify will receive a mere $1,358 on average each month. When Tracey Thompson became too sick to stand, it was clear she couldnt return to her former job as a chef. More than two years later, Thompson is unemployed and disabled, with cognitive dysfunction and overwhelming fatigue. She recently regained enough strength to lift a single frying pan, but remains housebound and mostly bed-bound. A lot of the normal avenues of work - like physical labor or mental labor - are cut off for me, she explained. You cant cook remotely. Since getting sick, Thompson has connected with other long-haulers who are similarly out-of-work. Theres a lot of people that are just barely hanging on ... by a thread, she said. And there are people who have definitely been going to work unwell. Unfortunately, pushing through long Covid symptoms to continue working can result in worsened health. But, as Thompson explains, people cant afford to take time off. Leigh, a physical therapist in Ohio who prefers to be identified by just her first name, is one such long-hauler. She sometimes finds herself forgetting interactions with patients and rarely has time to care for herself. If she could retain healthcare benefits while working less, shed do it. Im so sick of being tired all the time, she said. I dont want to let anyone down, but I am ... struggling. And Im not sure I want people to know how much. While long-haulers fight to maintain employment, a TikTok video about quiet quitting set off a flurry of news coverage describing workers who are saying no to hustle culture. As with the Great Resignation, most discussions of quiet quitting fail to address the impact of pandemic harms, focusing instead on perceived generational divides. To borrow a phrase often attributed to Mark Twain, its as though a TikTok meme went halfway around the world before the truth had time to put its shoes on. Quiet quitting and resignations may also be driven by recent removals of remote work options, mask mandates and quarantine requirements. Some long-haulers who can work part- or full-time are now sidelined due to increased risk of reinfection. These people are joined by millions of other high-risk individuals who have been increasingly marginalized from society, and now must fend for themselves. The connection between workplace safety, chronic illness and labor is not new. For decades, health justice activists have urged policymakers to respond to rising rates of disabled poverty, demanding better workplace accommodations and disability benefits. However, policymakers continually fail to adequately address these issues. Erasing disease is easier in a world where chronically ill people often seem to vanish from society altogether. Since we started covering long Covid in spring 2020, the patients we have spoken to have consistently detailed drastic financial issues. Yet little has been done to help. Instead, long-haulers burn through savings accounts, lose their homes and trudge back and forth to jobs they can no longer safely perform. Some might call this a Great Resignation, or quiet quitting. To us, its an example of government negligence in the face of a public health crisis, and the impossible choices facing chronically ill and high-risk workers today. Fixing the labor shortage means treating, accommodating and mitigating long Covid. It also requires building a society in which disabled people can participate.

Im not bringing this up because I want belated feel-better chocolates (although they wouldnt go amiss), but because I am aghast at the number of public figures merrily announcing that theyre working through Covid, like a deadly virus is no big deal.

A number of health experts have warned that public figures saying theyre just going to keep working from home while sick are minimising the risk of long Covid and encouraging others to think, If I have the virus, I can just push through it.

I have about an hour, and then its gone. Naomi Vann, a PE teacher at a special needs school, has been suffering from long Covid since November 2020, when she caught the virus for the second time. Ive got constant pain, which is pins and needles in my arms and hands, and when its really bad it goes into my face and my feet. My joints ache most of the time, like they do when you have flu, she said. I used to read every night before I went to sleep, and now I dont read as much, because I cant remember the characters and the plot properly. She forms her words slowly and carefully - conversation is another thing she now struggles with. The other thing I have is depression and anxiety. I have always been happy-go-lucky, but now Im on the maximum dose of depression and anxiety medication. Vann, is 53, has been on sick leave from the school where she worked for 27 years, and is now negotiating an exit settlement. When that is signed and sealed, she will join the 2.49 million people who are now economically inactive - not employed or actively seeking a job - because of long-term sickness. Thats the highest level since records began in 1993, and up more than 400,000 since the end of 2019 alone. Interactive This rapidly expanding group is one reason why the UKs activity rate - the proportion of adults either in work or looking for a job - has declined faster since the pandemic than in many major economies. As well as those with long-term health conditions, a large number of older workers have left the labour market over the past two years, many voluntarily. Stephen Evans, of thinktank the Learning and Work Institute (L&amp;W), said: There are now a million fewer people in the workforce than if pre-pandemic trends had continued, driven by rising numbers of people aged over 50 or with long-term sickness leaving the workforce. Having so many people too ill to work is not only painful and frustrating for employers struggling to recruit staff at a time when unemployment is at historic lows, but also a drag on economic growth. Many, like Vann, have such severe conditions that they could not feasibly be in work, but in a survey released this month, 581,000 people told the Office for National Statistics they would like a job. Labour market experts believe there may be many more who could work if they had the right treatment and support. The number of people not working because of long-term sickness was rising before the pandemic but has shot up since 2020. L&amp;W estimates that up to a third of the increase may relate to long Covid. Lesley Macniven, co-founder and chair of Long Covid Work, a support group for working people with long Covid, asked: What percentage of our working population has to become disabled by this before we realise that long Covid is a chronic problem? We have this massive cohort of half a million people who have been ill for over two years. Interactive A sufferer herself, Macniven is urging employers to treat those with long Covid sensitively, as well as calling on the government to offer more support. Another factor likely to be driving the rise in long-term sickness is the NHSs rapidly lengthening waiting lists, with 7 million people now awaiting routine treatment. Many of these can go on working while they wait; others cannot, and may drop out of the labour market. Danielle, who did not want to give her surname, has painful and debilitating osteoarthritis, and has been on the waiting list for two hip replacements for more than a year. She has kept working at an office job with a manufacturing firm near her home in Barnsley, but its becoming a struggle. Fortunately I have a very understanding manager: he is empathic and allows me to work from home when I need to. My worry is that as Im deteriorating, and my mobility is getting less and less, Ill be less and less able to make it into the office. Danielle said: I would be devastated [if I had to give up work] because I love my job - I absolutely love it. Im hoping it wouldnt come to that, but youve got to do whats best for the business as well. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: We do need a greater awareness of the way in which gaps in health and care provision are contributing to the problem we have with people of working age not working. He said the health system continued to face a capacity gap between what it was being asked to do - including bringing waiting lists down - and what it could achieve. He called on employers to be more sympathetic to staff awaiting treatment. I would very much encourage employers to recognise that waiting for health interventions may be a challenge for their workers and to support them in that, he said. The charity Versus Arthritis is calling for the NHS to be given a statutory duty to help those stuck on waiting lists for long periods. People who are waiting years for joint replacement surgery have their lives put on hold, often unable to work, but rarely receive the support they need while waiting, said a spokesperson. A third driver of the rise in inactivity due to long-term sickness is likely to be the increase in mental health conditions - and in many cases, the struggle to access treatment - since the pandemic. Many people want to work: to offer no help is a monumental waste of talent, but when we have a million vacancies, its an economic calamity as well Jon Ashworth, shadow pensions secretary With 1.8 million people currently on NHS mental health waiting lists, its clear that a significant number of the people currently not working due to sickness and waiting to see a clinician will be living with a mental health problem, said Paul Spencer, head of health, policy and campaigns at Mind. He added that some of these people might be able to return to work with the right support, while others would be unable to re-enter the workforce. All of these people need mental health support if we are to thrive as a country and grow the economy, he added. Work and pensions secretary Chloe Smith acknowledged the challenge of long-term sickness in a speech last Thursday, calling inactive workers a potential goldmine for growth and opportunity - if they could be tempted back into jobs. But she made it clear the government hoped to put the onus on employers. In return for the government helping businesses fill their vacancies, we are expecting employers to invest in their workforces progression and health, she said. But her Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth, called on the government to do more. Jobcentre staff, he said, were focused almost entirely on ensuring that claimants of out-of-work benefits were searching intensively for jobs - and on penalising them through the sanctions regime if they were not. Interactive He added: Many people want to work if they have the right support. To offer no help is not only a monumental waste of talent but, when we have a million vacancies and rising cost of living, its an economic calamity as well. Tony Wilson, of thinktank the Institute of Employment Studies, said the dramatic break the pandemic caused in many peoples working lives may also have contributed to the rise in numbers off work through long-term sickness. A lot of people were separated from their jobs, either through furlough or by being laid off, he said. And a lot of people with long-term health conditions who were laid off are now finding it very hard to get back in. Like Ashworth, Wilson argues that the government should be providing more help for people who, while they are not on any unemployment benefit, could nevertheless be coaxed or supported back into work. Even people with multiple and complex conditions can often get back to work with the right one-to-one support, he said. Sometimes its just about finding the right match: the right employer, the right workplace. For Vann, though, the dramatic change the pandemic wreaked in her life feels permanent. I had a panic attack when I realised that I was no longer going to be able to teach, she said. It kind of makes me feel worthless really, because I have lost my sense of purpose.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/jun\/09\/first-edition-boris-johnson-housing-right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/jun\/09\/first-edition-boris-johnson-housing-right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher","DATE":"2022-06-09 05:28:53","PLAIN_TEXT":"Good morning. If you are a rabbit and youre reading this sitting in a hat anywhere near Boris Johnson, First Editions advice to you today is: cling on for dear life. With the prime minister now displaying an existential interest in ways to demonstrate that discovering 41% of his own MPs wanting to get rid of him was actually a moment of triumph, the big ideas will be coming thick and fast in the coming days and weeks. First out of the blocks today: a speech in Lancashire focused on ways to make it easier for lower-paid people to buy homes. Previews this morning suggest that Johnson will announce changes to the rules (PS) to allow housing benefits to be used to get mortgages, and say he will accelerate housebuilding with new flatpack homes. But the most significant offer is an attempt to recreate Margaret Thatchers election-winning formula by updating her trademark right to buy policy, extending it to properties owned by housing associations. Thats the plan. Whether it works out is another thing. If you read todays newsletter you should come away with a sense of the history of the right to buy policy, how this new iteration would work in practice, and why many experts thinks its a terrible idea. If you dont, its not my fault, youre a rabbit. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Cost of living | Boris Johnsons attempt to reset his troubled premiership has received a double blow after petrol prices had their biggest daily rise in 17 years and a leading international thinktank said the UK economy would slow to a standstill next year.

In depth: A look inside Johnsons housing extension Margaret Thatcher, left, hands over 39 Amersham Road, Harold Hill to the Greater London Councils 12,000th council house buyer, James Patterson and his wife, Maureen. Photograph: PAPA ArchivePress Association Ima Even though its more than 40 years old, the changes wrought by Margaret Thatchers right to buy policy can still be felt in Britain today. It established the story the Conservative party continues to tell about itself, of being crusaders for opportunity for all; it transformed the way people thought about what it meant to own or rent their homes; and it shifted almost 2m social housing dwellings into private hands. It became the emblematic policy idea of a prime minister who was pretty unpopular at the time, only to rule for another decade. No wonder Boris Johnson wants a piece of it. No wonder, either, that he isnt the first Conservative leader to propose extending right to buy to housing associations. But there are very good reasons that it hasnt happened before. Heres what you need to know. *** What is the government expected to propose today? In his speech to backbenchers ahead of the no-confidence vote, Boris Johnson promised that if he won, he and housing secretary Michael Gove would be setting out plans to kindle that dream of homeownership in the hearts of millions who currently believe it is beyond their means. The proposed mechanism is to extend the right to buy to people living in properties owned by housing associations - not-for-profit bodies which rent low-cost homes to about 2.5 million people. Crucially, housing associations are not state-owned. At the moment, people living in council properties can get a discount of up to 70% of the market value of their home, up to a maximum of PS87,000, or PS116,200 in London. There is a scheme in place for housing associations, but it limits the discount to a maximum of PS16,000. *** What did Margaret Thatchers model look like? In his 2015 book Promised You A Miracle: UK80-82, Guardian columnist Andy Beckett writes that the 1980 Housing Act envisaged a revolution in how a large minority of Britons lived. It seemed possible, in part, because there was an abundance of social housing: 5.5m homes were provided by local authorities and housing associations in England, or 31% of the total stock. Now anybody who had lived in council housing for more than three years would be entitled to own it. Tenants were given a 33% discount on market value at the three-year point, rising to 50% after 20, up to a ceiling of PS50,000. And they were guaranteed 100% mortgages by the local authority. Against average property prices in 1980 of PS23,500, it was an extraordinarily good deal for those able to take advantage of it. *** How did it play out in practice? Right to buy was a hugely powerful - even life-changing - policy for exactly the aspirational working-class voters who Thatcher was trying to woo. By the end of 1982, more than 240,000 homes had been sold to their tenants in England alone. But within a few years, a significant gap was visible between tenants who were buying and those who were not. A government study published in 1986 found that buyers were disproportionately drawn from the middle-aged and the better-off. Their incomes were more than double those of people who remained tenants. Meanwhile, rents for the worse-off council tenants who remained rocketed - going up 55% relative to earnings in a decade. *** What does the landscape look like today? In the 22 years since the scheme was first introduced, 1,992,799 sales to tenants have been completed, the government says. Less than 5% of the homes sold off have been replaced, according to Shelter, and the available stock has dropped from that 5.5m figure to 4.2m by 2020. Meanwhile, a large proportion of right-to-buy homes are now in the hands of private landlords: in 2017, Inside Housing magazine reported that 40% of them were being rented out, and their tenants were paying more than twice the rent charged by local authorities. Average property prices in Britain have gone from that 1980 figure of PS23,500 to PS278,436 as of March. In other words, the 1980s right to buy generation received a huge financial windfall from the government, which accrued as the property market rocketed - and their successors are paying exorbitant private rents, up 15% in two years, because theres no council housing to put them in. Scotland and Wales abandoned the policy several years ago. *** Where does the idea of extending the scheme to housing associations come from? Its been around from the beginning. In 1982, the Guardian reported on proposals to make much the same change Johnson is proposing today - news which led the director of the National Federation of Housing Associations to complain: Charities have a duty that lasts in perpetuity ... it is vital to keep these homes for the old, the disadvantaged and the young in the future. The change never happened - but a version of the idea popped up in David Camerons 2015 manifesto, only to be junked after an unsuccessful pilot project in the West Midlands, which found that nothing like enough of the properties being sold off were being replaced with new stock - a red line for housing associations who were participating. (We might think of Nick Cleggs claim that either Cameron or George Osborne once told him: I dont understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing - it just creates Labour voters.) *** Could Johnson succeed where others failed? Experts are sceptical. Gavin Smart, the chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, says that the scheme is not the answer and would be at the expense of the poorest households, arguing that the estimated PS70,000 subsidy per household would be better spent on addressing the housing stock crisis. And as Rob Booth says in his essential analysis, Theresa Mays former housing adviser Toby Lloyd points out that offering affordable housing tenants sale discounts could create tension with private renters. Others point to the fact that ... not many people living in housing associations seem to want this right very much. A report on the West Midlands pilot found that just 1.2% of households would be expected to buy under the scheme. Experts also note the fundamental problem - which is that the housing associations which own the homes have historically never welcomed the idea, and it would be extremely expensive to win them over. In other words, the best hope for opponents of the policy is that it will never happen in the first place. And indeed, one report this morning suggests that internal estimates have priced a national version of the scheme at about PS3bn a year, far in excess of an intended budget of PS500m. That probably means any changes will be limited to more pilot programmes. Another Boris Johnson magic trick: a rabbit pulled out of a hat, which immediately disappears.

Given that Indonesias G20 slogan plastered all around Bali says: Recover Together, Recover Stronger, it was not an auspicious performance by the worlds leaders. Unfortunately, there is precious little sign of recovery at the G20, either at a political or economic level. The G20, according to Dr Tristen Naylor, an assistant professor of history at Cambridge University, has worked best historically when there has been a galvanising crisis affecting everyone equally, especially the financial contagion in 2008. He said the post-Covid economic recession might have brought the world together again, but this is not a crisis hitting every country in the same way, so there is no solution on which all sides can agree. Add in the Ukraine war, and the US-Sino tensions over Taiwan, and there is very little oxygen left. Although a communique, in preparation for months, will be produced, its focus on issues such as digital transformation, post-Covid recovery and food security is unlikely to stretch beyond the non-committal platitudes that normally fill such statements. Indonesia has tried to keep Ukraine off the agenda by saying the G20 is primarily an economic forum, not a geopolitical security forum. But such distinctions are hard to maintain since the Ukraine war is a total hybrid war in which gas prices and the seizure of Russian central bank assets are as much a weapon of war as a high mobility artillery rocket system. The Argentinian foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, standing in for his ailing boss, put it well on Tuesday when he told colleagues: In the northern hemisphere, the merchants of death trade lethal weapons, but in the southern hemisphere, food becomes more expensive or is lacking, and what ends up killing is not bullets or missiles, but poverty and hunger. It seems incredible that, when we have not yet overcome the shock caused by a pandemic, Russia unleashes a military invasion of Ukraine, putting world peace in crisis. Kristalina Georgieva, the international monetary fund managing director, agreed: You cant solve a problem of geopolitics with economic policy measures. It will be very difficult to bring the level of economic cooperation to the level it should be ... Ending the war in Ukraine is the single most powerful factor to turn around the world economy. She told the group: Hopeful signs of recovery last year were replaced by an abrupt slowdown in the world economy because of Covid, the war in Ukraine and climate disasters on all continents. The difficulty is that to tame inflation, the US needs to raise interest rates, but that strengthens the dollar, making the goods that poorer countries import more expensive. For Indonesia, laying on a visually sumptuous summit, it was a relief that Vladimir Putin chose to stay away, and the Russian leaders substitute, Lavrov, did not come into the cavernous conference room to hear the passionate televised address by Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Staged walkouts were avoided, even if the family photo, the annual display of masculine leadership, had to be forgone. All unhappy families are after all unhappy in their own way, and this family is frankly bordering on the dysfunctional, and will probably remain so until Putin is forced into a retreat, or Moscow rethinks its imperial mission. So much of the interest at the summit has focused on whether the swing states in the Ukraine war- India, South Africa, Turkey and China - would put any real pressure on Russia to recognise this war has been a mistake. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, has used the summit as his coming out party after nearly two years in unsplendid Covid isolation, meeting as many as six world leaders. Naylor said he thought Xi went as far as he could to express his displeasure at Putins methods and the length of time the war has continued. The behind-the-scenes negotiations on extending the grain deal allowing Russian and Ukrainian wheat to reach world markets was probably the most substantive achievement of the summit, and reflected the fact that the combatants in the war are fighting for the public opinion of the global south as much as themselves. But whether the G20 will regain its status as a global governance powerhouse, and a more representative successor to the G7 as once predicted, seems unlikely. With breadth comes division, leading to shallowness, and, it seems, the lowest common denominator. By contrast it is the G7, once thought to be dead on its feet, that has been galvanised. Bound by a common ideology, its leaders met six times remotely before Junes actual G7 summit in Germany. It has, in the view of the US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, become the organising committee for the free world. The G20 has yet to find itself any equivalent status.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/oct\/15\/demonise-or-romanticise-choice-in-framing-working-class-lives","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/oct\/15\/demonise-or-romanticise-choice-in-framing-working-class-lives","DATE":"2022-10-15 18:23:00","PLAIN_TEXT":"An old man walking between rows of terraced housing and, behind him, the sky erased by the huge bow of a ship being built. A teenager picking coal on a beach. A man manoeuvring his horse and cart around a car dumped by the sea. A young girl playing hula-hoop in a desolate, rubbish-strewn landscape. Chris Killip and Graham Smiths photographs, mostly of the north-east of England, in the 1970s and 1980s, the era of deindustrialisation, of smashed communities and broken lives, look like images of a different world. Two exhibitions opened last week in London showcasing their photography, one a retrospective of Killips work, the other a recreation of a joint exhibition, Another Country, first shown in 1985. They raise questions both of the nature of photography and of our perceptions of working-class lives. Smith came from South Bank, a working-class area of Middlesbrough, his father a third-generation steelworker. Most of his photography is of the local streets and pubs, of the last days of the steelworks and shipyards and of the dereliction that followed. The pubs he so often photographed, Smith wrote, are used by those whose future is the... next good drink. Killip, who died of cancer two years ago, came from the Isle of Man, but settled in the north-east and photographed working-class communities across the country. There is a lyricism and humanism to the photos of both men, born of a deep empathy with those whose lives they were capturing. Helen and her hula-hoop, Lynemouth, Northumberland, 1984. Photograph: (c) Chris Killip Photography TrustMagnum Photos For all the warmth and humanity, though, these are images shot through with a despairing bleakness. Even in the most hopeful of photos - employees at a Pirelli factory displaying an almost craft-like relationship to their work, men quietly repairing fishing nets, punks losing themselves on a night out - there is an edge of desolation. It is a bleakness perhaps best expressed in a pair of Killips twinned photos. The first, taken in 1975, shows a rundown terrace. In the second, taken from the same spot two years later, the houses have been demolished, the rubble strewn across the street. What remains intact is a piece of graffiti painted across a half-shattered wall. Dont vote. Prepare for revolution. It was as if the outside world was mocking the community, telling it: The only change will be the change we impose, and not just the physical infrastructure, or the social bonds of the community, but your hopes, too, will be reduced to rubble. Related: We wanted to value and document working-class culture: the photography of Chris Killip and Graham Smith In Poverty Safari, his blistering account of what it is like to grow up in a poor, working-class community, Darren McGarvey observes that in poorer communities, there is a pervasive belief that things will never change. This may seem like a self-defeating view, he adds, but people in such communities learn that the real problems are not of poverty as such but the problems of changing anything: Whats difficult is how many walls you come up against when you try to do anything about it. The system is designed not to meet working-class needs but for working-class people to be engaged by facilitators and mentors who help them water down whatever they want to do in order that community aspirations align with those in positions of power or influence. The writer Lynsey Hanley similarly observes, in an essay for the Killip retrospective, that the photographs cant but make you ask the question: why dont we revolt here? Why does there seem to be no limit to what working-class people will endure at the hands of the rich and powerful? Killips answer, she concludes, seems to be because we know we wont win. It is a despondency almost tangible in the photos. Sandy and his Aunty Elsie, Early Doors in the Commercial, South Bank, Middlesbrough, 1983 Photograph: (c) Graham Smith There was another world, of course, the world of resistance expressed through the miners strike and inner-city riots, the Right to Work movement and squatters groups. But these having been brutally crushed, Smith and Killip seem to be saying, agency and resistance were now expressed as much in ensuring survival as in fomenting change. The exhibitions also raise questions of how working-class lives are depicted. There is something predatory in the act of taking a picture, the essayist and critic Susan Sontag observed. By seeing them as they never see themselves, by having knowledge of them that they can never have, Sontag adds, a photograph turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed. There is an element of truth in this. Killip himself was chased off and beaten up by locals when he first tried to take photos of the sea-coalers - the men and children who spent hours scouring beaches, often knee-deep in water, for the spoil tipped into the sea by the coalmines, to be bagged and taken away in horse-drawn carts. The authorities used to photograph them, too, to prosecute and deny benefits to the men who worked in this shadow economy. It took three years for Killip to build sufficient trust to be allowed to take photos on the beach. But out of that trust came some of the most remarkable photos, exposing the seam along which the Middle Ages and the twentieth century are entwined, as Killip himself put it. The issue Sontag raises is not just about how a photograph is taken but also about how we perceive it. When we look upon an image, we do not see it through the photographers eyes, still less through the minds of the subjects of the photograph, but, rather, through the social framework through which we come to understand any issue. Its a framework that, when it comes to working-class people, either condescends to them as victims, demonises them if they challenge authority or, occasionally, romanticises them as heroes. Too often, they are seen through the lens of otherness and through the sensibilities of outsiders. Just listen to todays discussions of the left behind or of the white working class. Killip and Smith did not take photos of another world. They recorded our world, showing what had been done to working-class communities and what such communities have had to do to survive. And, yet, both then and now, there is more to such communities than passive survival; there is also active challenge and resistance, too, seen today in everything from the summer of strikes to Enough is Enough. That, too, needs to be nurtured and celebrated. And photographed. * Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The new workplace flexibility being offered to staff by their employers could leave office blocks empty across Britains towns and cities, the real estate consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH) found in its latest office market report, as companies cut back on the amount of space they rent. Related: Time and money: why Londoners refuse to drop working from home A 20% reduction in the office space needed by businesses, compared with before Covid, represents about 26m sq ft - equivalent to more than 15 times the amount of office space in the 50-storey One Canada Square skyscraper in Londons Canary Wharf, or more than double the entire stock of the Reading office market. After spending months working from home during the pandemic, office-based staff are reluctant to spend the entire week in their workplace and are asking their employers if they can continue working remotely at least part of the time. Only 15% of the 50 companies who contributed to the LSH survey, which focused mostly on London and the south-east, reported their staff were spending at least four days a week in the office, compared with 90% before the pandemic, despite the lifting of all coronavirus restrictions. Just under half of employers (43%) reported staff were attending the office for only two days a week, while nearly a third (29%) said the most common rate of attendance was three days a week. As a result, office occupiers are considering how much office space they need post-Covid and what kind of space they require.

He said: There simply isnt much to choose from and, where it is available, occupiers are prepared to pay a handsome premium to secure it.

Joe Biden and his administration are scrambling to address the growing threat, pressing Vladimir Putin in a highly anticipated meeting on Wednesday to take action against the rise of ransomware attacks. Biden said he gave Putin a list of 16 areas - mostly in critical infrastructure - that are off limits for cyber-attacks. Ransomware has long posed a cybersecurity threat to companies and infrastructure, but experts say the problem has exploded in recent years. Last year was especially egregious, with ransomware victims in the US paying out nearly $350m, according to the global security group the Institute for Security and Technology - a 311% increase over 2019. The FBI director, Christopher Wray, highlighted this startling figure at a congressional hearing. Ransomware alone, the total volume of amounts paid in ransomware has tripled over the last year, Wray said. We think the cyber threat is increasing almost exponentially. Experts attribute the surge to a number of factors, but they say one of the most critical has been the shift to remote working during the pandemic. When you are working from home, you are not behind the castle walls any more, said John Hammond, a cybersecurity researcher at the security firm Huntress. You are working with your own devices, away from the safe perimeter of corporate networks. Criminals have found an increasingly lucrative path in ransomware attacks, in which a hacker breaks into a company or governments network and seizes data or systems, demanding payment for their return. Employees on computers outside the safety of office networks face more risks. Company networks generally only allow trusted devices to connect, reducing the risk of outside actors or malware entering. They also often have stronger protections in place than the average consumer wifi network. Related: Age of the cyber-attack: US struggles to curb rise of digital destabilization The transition that were seeing to working from home has contributed dramatically to the rise in successful ransomware attacks, said Israel Barak, the chief information security officer at the security firm Cybereason. There are a lot more open doors to access networks now that employees are working remotely. One of the most consequential ransomware hacks in recent months, on the Colonial Pipeline - which shut down systems that supply 45% of the eastern United States fuel - has now been attributed to the breach of a virtual private network, commonly used by remote employees to connect to a company system. VPNs are the most secure way for employees to connect to a corporate network from home, but they can pose their own risks if they are out of date or do not use multi-factor authentication. A spokesman for Colonial Pipeline said the VPN that was compromised was an older model and not the VPN that employees were actively using to remotely access the Colonial network. But experts say any time employees work offsite using their own networks, risks are involved. There have been a number of documented attacks on companies carried out through VPN access since the pandemic began, including on the Japanese game developer Capcom and a European industrial firm. Stephanie Hinds, acting US attorney for the northern district of California, peaks about the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack during a news conference. Photograph: Jonathan ErnstUPIRexShutterstock In June 2020, the justice department identified a Russian ransomware group that was deliberately targeting people who work from home during the pandemic to access corporate and government networks. Corporate and government offices have a number of measures in place meant to keep bad actors out, said Joseph Carson, the chief security scientist at the cloud security firm Thycotic. That includes secure internet routers with unique passwords, firewalls that monitor incoming traffic and keep out threats, and company devices with additional security in place. Most of those protections are pretty much useless when the devices have been moved to the public internet, he said. Though not a ransomware attack, the hack of Twitter in 2020 July was more directly attributed to remote working. Hackers called several Twitter employees claiming to be IT department employees and offered to help connect through the companys virtual private network being used by employees working from home. The 17-year-old hacker behind that heist collected $117,000 in bitcoin from the attack. Security breaches at large have also been on the rise over the past year. The vast majority of IT teams - 82% - experienced an increase in cyber-attacks in 2020, according to a survey from security firm Sophos. Attacks are rising not only because of remote working but as criminals become more organized and ransomware attacks become easier to execute, said Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon. The rise of cryptocurrency, which is easier to send online and less traceable than traditional money orders, has facilitated the trend. Bitcoin has made it much easier for these people to extract money, he said. We have got the combination of information security getting significantly worse with the rise of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the House homeland security committee has recently advanced multiple bills aimed at enhancing cybersecurity in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline hack. The Biden administration is also working to improve cybersecurity responses. It issued a letter to corporate executives and business leaders on what the private sector needs to be doing to protect against ransomware threats - including practices like multifactor authentication, encryption and skilled security teams. Companies were also advised to back up data and test systems regularly. The threats are serious and they are increasing, Anne Neuberger, a cybersecurity adviser at the National Security Council, said in the letter. We urge you to take these critical steps to protect your organizations and the American public.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/may\/16\/greggs-sales-cities-working-from-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/may\/16\/greggs-sales-cities-working-from-home","DATE":"2022-05-16 10:10:47","PLAIN_TEXT":"Greggs has revealed that its sales in large cities and locations near offices are lagging behind those elsewhere in the UK as a result of the shift to home working. Roger Whiteside, the outgoing chief executive of the bakery chain, said transaction numbers in city centres were 10% below pre-Covid levels. There are less people going to offices and less people going shopping. I suspect it will never go back to the numbers pre-Covid, although it might get a bit better, he said. The findings were backed by independent data from analysts at Springboard published on Monday, which showed the number of shoppers in central London last week 22% down on 2019 levels, 16.2% lower in regional cities excluding the capital, and 17% down in office locations. That compares with 11.4% lower numbers in London suburbs and 12.5% in historic towns. However, Whiteside said Greggs was opening more outlets in city centres, including one in Leicester Square in central London, as it took advantage of lower rents while others had pulled out. He said sites in the capital were still busier than anywhere else despite being less popular than before the pandemic. Greggs said sales in transport hubs, such as railway and bus stations, had shown a marked increase as day trips, holidays and office workers return. Whiteside said there were no signs that customers had reduced spending as a result of the cost of living squeeze, and the chain reported a 27.4% rise in sales at established outlets in the 19 weeks to 14 May. The company said there had been strong demand for its new hot food, such as chicken goujons and potato wedges, as sales rebounded after the loosening of Covid-19 restrictions. Presenting his last set of results before stepping down, Whiteside said the success of hot food was an important part of Greggs business strategy. This is a market opportunity. People want value for money [food] in the evening, he said. The company warned that it would increase prices for the third time this year - by up to 10% on some products - with most price rises between 5p and 10p, similar to increases in January. The company also put up prices on some items in April when the government removed VAT relief. Whiteside said Greggs would watch competitors closely to try to remain competitive, adding: It is inescapable in the current climate that prices will have to move. Related: Next and Wagamama face investor backlash over CEO bonuses The company said: Consumer incomes will clearly be under pressure in the second half of the year. We will continue to work to mitigate the impact of cost pressures while protecting Greggs reputation for exceptional value. Greggs said in March that prices were likely to increase because of the rising cost of ingredients, energy and fuel after Russias invasion of Ukraine. The baker, best known for its sausage rolls and pasties, predicted that profits would fail to increase in the year ahead as it tried to offset cost inflation of up to 7%, up from 5% at the start of 2022.

Bonus payouts for Whiteside amounted to more than double his basic salary of PS575,209, taking his total package to PS1.9m including benefits. The investment adviser Pirc said shareholders should vote against the remuneration report, arguing that Whitesides pay was excessive and amounted to 79 times that of a regular employee.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/commentisfree\/2022\/may\/15\/let-them-eat-cheese-working-from-home-is-here-to-stay","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/commentisfree\/2022\/may\/15\/let-them-eat-cheese-working-from-home-is-here-to-stay","DATE":"2022-05-15 09:00:27","PLAIN_TEXT":"One of the bestselling business books of all time is called Who Moved My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson and has sold 30m copies worldwide since 1998. It is a book about change and features two sets of creatures, mouse and human, who are either trying to replicate old patterns and find long-lost cheese or be adventurous and discover new supplies of it. It is rather a fitting parable for the emerging battle lines around post-pandemic working practices, specifically how much knowledge workers use the office and what productivity gains look like with new hybrid working patterns. Another Johnson is also using cheese to make his point. The prime minister said on Friday: My experience of working from home is you spend an awful lot of time walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese, then walking very slowly back to your laptop. This message - that all you do is nibble unproductively and waste time when you work from home - has been echoed by a series of poster-men (and it is men of a certain generation) for RTO or return to office from business and government around the world, including David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, who called working from home an aberration; Lord Sugar, who railed against the lazy gits at PWC who are working summer hours out of office; and of course Jacob Rees-Mogg, who took to touring empty Whitehall offices and leaving passive-aggressive Sorry you were out notes on desks. From a management and leadership perspective, all I can say is that this strategy is not much better than calling workers cheese-eating surrender monkeys (a term memorably coined by The Simpsons - the same year that Who Moved My Cheese? was published - to describe the French), and it is interesting that some politicians and business leaders are deciding that attacking the workforce is their best line of defence against the seismic changes they are facing: the tightest labour market in decades, rising inflation, and a global rejection of a return to office life with all the economic and cultural disruption that implies. The timing of Boris Johnsons remarks coincided with the media briefing by Rees-Mogg that the civil service can be cut by as much a a fifth. He has deliberately conflated the question of cuts to the service with criticism of the emerging hybrid model of three days a week in the office and two remotely, which is fast becoming the norm in post-pandemic cities around the world. To do so is not just bad politics but flies in the face of evidence that new working patterns which give workers agency, flexibility and a mix of in-office social time with self-managed, less monitored work is productive. Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford showed in a study of 16,000 workers that productivity can rise by as much as 13% on this basis. Data from Ipsos consistently shows that across all demographics flexibility to work differently is desirable, with 65% saying they are more productive when they work flexibly. So why the political and management resistance? Lets go back to cheese. Old habits die hard, and changing command-and-control models is an undeniable challenge. Implementing hybrid is hard and will involve experimentation and iteration. The indecisive, change-resistant human characters in Who Moved My Cheese? are called Hem and Haw. It takes them considerably longer to realise that they have to go through the maze they are in to find new sources of cheese than it does their more entrepreneurial counterparts Sniff and Scurry. Today Hem and Haw are those leaders who would prefer to see pointless presenteeism rather than be curious enough to find out how their staff like to work and can be best productive. The post-pandemic office is entirely different from how it was before. Teleconferencing and technology have collided with cultural shifts, and people want to better integrate their work self with the rest of their life. When it comes to the politics of work and the post-pandemic workplace, 2022 will be remembered for the battle between the fridge and the watercooler. But to borrow from another phrase, those creating the policies and tasked with making them work need to keep it real. Change is in the air and someone just moved the cheese.

The new model will apply to staff in the US, but also those in the UK and other countries. To make it work, the company said it would focus in-person collaboration on roughly quarterly get-togethers and aim to bundle work together into two product releases a year, its chief executive and co-founder, Brian Chesky, said. We want to hire and retain the best people in the world (like you), Chesky wrote in an email to staff. If we limited our talent pool to a commuting radius around our offices, we would be at a significant disadvantage. The best people live everywhere, not concentrated in one area. And by recruiting from a diverse set of communities, we will become a more diverse company. Now, I understand the anxiety of not seeing people in an office- - how do you know if your employees are doing their jobs when you cant see them? For me, its simple: I trust you, and flexibility only works when you trust the people on your team. Employees will not be entirely free to move as they see fit. For tax reasons, they will need to have a permanent base in the country theyre hired in. If they work overseas, they can spend no more than 90 days a year in any given country, and are responsible for handling their own work authorisation. And they do still need to consider time zones, and think about how to actually get to the gatherings. Crucially, however, the company will no longer pay people based on regional differences. Starting in June, well have single pay tiers by country for both salary and equity, Chesky said. If your pay was set using a lower location-based pay tier, youll receive an increase in June.

Given Labor has a majority in the House of Representatives, he will take the job when parliament resumes on Tuesday. Dick said in a statement: When parliament resumes next week, I intend to accept the governments nomination as speaker of the House of Representatives for the 47th parliament ... I am honoured to be endorsed today by the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Out of deep respect for the office of speaker I will be consulting with members from across the House of Representatives, to consult and seek their support. I will now follow and respect the processes of election to this important role. Dick is a member of the right faction, which will select the speaker because Sue Lines, from the left faction, will be Senate president in the 47th parliament. Dick won Labors endorsement technically unopposed, although Victorias Rob Mitchell had put himself into contention for it before formal nominations. Labor MP Sharon Claydon will be the deputy speaker. Updated at 9.33am BST 9.10am BST Aemo confirms gas intervention in Victoria The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) has confirmed in a statement that it has taken steps to manage tight gas supplies. The energy regulator says it has activated the Gas Supply Guarantee mechanism to ensure additional gas supplies from Queensland-based gas producers to support the National Electricity Market (Nem). They added that there has so far been no impact to gas supply in Victoria: The producers and pipeline operator have responded positively to the request for additional gas supply. AEMO will continue to work with the parties to understand gas supply availability. Challenging generation conditions experienced from early June continue in the NEM. This has resulted in a greater reliance on gas-powered generation and larger than forecast inventory reduction at the Iona gas storage facility in Victoria. In response, AEMO has issued two threat to system security notifications (11 July and 18 July) to reduce the depletion rates at Iona. This included an initial request for participants to cease purchasing gas from Victorias Domestic Wholesale Gas Market (DWGM) for supply to other jurisdictions, and then a second request to cease purchases for Victorian electricity generation. Market participants are responding to AEMOs requests and directions to maintain a secure operating state for Victorias gas system. At this stage, there is no impact to gas supply in Victoria. AEMO expects the gas supply guarantee and threat to system security mechanisms to need to remain in effect until 30 September 2022 or until gas supplies are sufficient and the threat to gas supply caused by Iona storage inventory depletion has subsided.

Considering it will likely be the first piece of legislation tabled by the new government, and with the State of the Environment report release in the background, Andrews was asked if the Liberal party would reconsider: Processes are very important. Can I assure you, there have already been a number of discussions between myself and some of my colleagues. Ive been speaking broadly to the people here on the Gold Coast about issues that are of concern to them, particularly in relation to climate change and to legislation. Ive already asked the question before about what the implications will be of legislating. Its not clear to me at this stage what the point is of legislating. The aims of the government - it would seem to me they need to get on with what they proposed, which is probably limited at the moment, they need to get on with delivering rather than what seems to be more than a grandstanding exercise to try the legislate a target. I dont see the point in doing that. Updated at 9.07am BST 8.37am BST Aemo intervenes to prevent gas shortage in Victoria The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) has intervened to prevent a potential gas shortage in Victoria, according to the states energy minister, Lily DAmbrosio. DAmbrosio told ABC Radio Melbourne that Aemo had triggered the gas supply guarantee this afternoon, as reserves in the states storage facility continue to fall. She said the trigger will mean the energy regulator will have greater visibility of the sale and supply of gas, in an attempt to change market behaviour: That means theyll have greater visibility of the sale and supply of gas across the market including Victoria but in other states, to get some transparency here, When youve got greater transparency in the market, the market starts changing its behaviour, and frankly, the market has been able to get away with too much here. More visibility should mean, as it did in April [when the guarantee was last triggered], that gas goes to where its needed. The Iona gas storage facility is due to fall to an all-time low of six petajoules by 6 August, which could result in gas supply shortfall across the state. DAmbrosio said the state had more than enough supply, but blamed the situation on greed: A lot of this is driven by greed across gas producers. They will follow the dollar, and were about protecting consumers, making sure that they pay no more than what is deemed to be a fair price and thats why that price cap is there. Frankly, a fair price should be paid for gas. Weve got more than enough supply to be able to meet our needs and it should be provided at a fair price. Guardian Australia has reached out to Aemo for confirmation. Updated at 8.42am BST 8.28am BST Karen Andrews says former environment minister did not delay release of environment report Shadow home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, was also on ABCs Afternoon Briefing earlier this afternoon, and denied that the former environment minister, Sussan Ley, had held back on releasing the State of the Environment report: The advice that came through from Sussan Ley, former environment minister, is that at all times she complied with the requirements for releasing documents. I think it is fair to say that all Australians are focused on the environment, we want to do the best thing for environment. One of the key tenets of the Liberal party is to protect the natural environment for future generations. So, we all want to work very proactively towards supporting the environment. We just need to make sure that what we are doing is reasonable, and that it does set up future generations properly here in Australia.

The Advertiser is reporting Spurrier has mild symptoms, and had been visiting a relative interstate over the weekend. It is her first infection. It comes as new modelling shows South Australia is facing an exponential increase in hospitalisations in the coming weeks, with over 400 patients a day predicted. SA health minister, Chris Picton, told reporters earlier today that the health system was under serious pressure, with over 900 staff currently off due to Covid infections: That clearly places pressure in terms of staffing, where youve got increased pressure on the hospital system and reduced staff numbers. Updated at 8.06am BST 7.50am BST Hollie Hughes says climate change is not Australias problem Shadow assistant minister for climate change, Hollie Hughes, has told ABCs Afternoon Briefing that climate change is not Australias problem. Yes, she is a shadow assistant minister for climate change, denying that climate change is a problem for Australia. She had been asked why previous environment minister, Sussan Ley, hadnt released the Graeme Samuel report when it was handed to her in December, but Hughes decided to respond by discussing mining, farmers and the German Greens. Heres what she said: I honestly cant comment on that, I dont know. I havent heard that, that is not what I seen. It was released today. What I am concerned about [is that] Ms Plibersek, the member for Sydney, doesnt really understand the first thing about agriculture in our country, let alone support mining. And the best environmentalists are very often the farmers. But listening to some of the commentary around today, I am very concerned for what sort of legislation they are going to want to introduce that could impact farming land ... but also impact our ability to continue to mine, to also look for these coal and gas reserves, because the whole world is looking for those of the moment. But this Labor government seems intent on turning the lights out, shutting down at industry, for an issue that is a global issue. Climate change is not Australias problem, it is not a regional problem. Our emissions are 1.3%. We can shut everything down and we will make zero difference but we dont see any moves by this Labor government but to call out China for its emissions that are increasing. The German Greens are turning on coal-fired power. I think they know to give them a call to show how important it is to dispatch energy to keep the country running. That is one concern I have with regards to some of the rhetoric around this. But also, I think we need to be mindful - and I know Sussan will have something to say - ... but a lot of these environmental impacts around planning and development are actually run by state governments [so where do we] draw the line between what we can do federally and what is the responsibility of the state government and in fact some councils? Updated at 7.59am BST 7.41am BST Hanson-Young was also asked if the Greens were prepared to withdraw their demands of no new coal and gas, in the name of finding consensus on the environment: Well, Im really looking forward to sitting down with the minister and talking about what we can do to halt the extinction crisis, to stop the destruction of habitat and to stop making climate pollution worse and having a climate trigger in our environmental laws would go a long way to that. You cant just have structural reform, which is going to take some time, while carrying on business as usual as approving big projects, big mines, coal and gas projects, that are going to make not just the climate change crisis worse but our job of halting this environmental collapse harder. No point in gathering the fire blankets on one side while you continue to pour petrol on the fire with the other. Updated at 8.13am BST 7.31am BST Sarah Hanson-Young says environment report a code red for nature Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, has said the Graeme Samuel review is a code red for nature and that Australias forests, wildlife, and environment in general are on the brink of a very serious collapse. Hanson-Young was on ABC News earlier, and added that Australias current environment laws have not been good enough: We know that our environment laws have not been good enough to protect the environment, but we also know that successive governments havent done their job in standing up for the environment. All of this is now being fuelled by the climate crisis. It is a double whammy for nature and land clearing, native forest logging, there is destruction of habitat - its making climate change worse and then in return climate change is super charging the environmental crisis. So, we need to pull out all stops. Responding to the Samuel review from two years ago is the first thing - at the top of the list that needs to be done, of course. Theres lots of opportunity for us to work as fast as possible in parliament to fix the environment laws. We need to see a climate trigger in the laws so that when big projects, mines or developments are assessed. And given environmental approval, theyre assessed for their climate impact as well. We know climate change is a big threat. The minister has powers right now in front of her she can use. She doesnt need parliament to stop some of these bad projects on her desk and she should use that power.

Thomas was on ABC Radio Melbourne this morning and said the state government needed to give parents information to make their own decision, rather than offering mandates: The best tool is information. We need to take our time and continue to educate and explain to those parents who are concerned about mask-wearing why it works. What I have seen is an additional take-up of mask-wearing over the past week or so, as people are informing themselves and learning about the current wave of the Omicron virus.

Queensland today recorded almost 10,000 new cases overnight, taking the total known cases in the state to over 54,000. Earlier today, health minister Yvette DAth told reporters modelling had failed to predict the size of the third wave the state is currently facing: We thought and the advice we were getting and the modelling we saw at the start of the year that wed keep having waves for months and years, but theyd slowly reduce and our immunity would build.

I am wearing a mask now. You will have noticed the minister is wearing a mask as well. This is our leadership role for the community. This will not be forever but for the next few weeks this is the way we can actually influence the spread of the virus, protect vulnerable people in our community and also protect our healthcare systems which are already under strain. Asked if mask mandates should be reinstated across the states, the health minister, Mark Butler, said mask mandates were not part of the health advice received last week. The CMOs statement reflects the advice that was issued only on Friday I think in writing by all of the chief health officers across the country, all of the jurisdictional chief health officers, who strongly encourage the community to wear a mask in indoor spaces, particularly crowded indoor spaces where theres not the ability to socially distance, and I think that is really the position. As we move into this phase of the pandemic, providing members of the community with very clear information about what they can do to protect themselves and to minimise the size and the impact of this wave. [The need to mandate mask wearing] is not the advice that was issued by the chief health officers last week. Updated at 6.04am BST 5.49am BST Government in talks with ADF to expand aged care surge workforce Health minister wants to see surge workforce in aged care increase The health minister and chief medical officer are asked about the demands for more surge workforce from the aged care sector and to explain the bottleneck preventing it being delivered. Butler responded: Over recent months there has been a mix of reliance on the department surge workforce, which is nurses and personal care workers contracted or engaged by the department to be provided to aged-care facilities who need them. Just last week I think about 1,900 shifts in the aged care sector were worked or were filled by nurses and PCAs from the departments surge workforce. Thats higher than the peak we got to in the January wave so Im very pleased that that element of the departments actions is working well. Were looking at ways in which we can expand that. Were also in discussions with the ADF which had been starting to roll down its presence in aged-care facilities. Its obviously got a range of other work it needs to do. It responded remarkably well, magnificently well, to the recent floods, for example. So were talking to the ADF still right now, actively talking to them about what ability they have to continue to contribute to support members in aged care as well and obviously talking to the sector. Were certainly going to continue to try to see our surge workforce capacity increase, its running at a higher rate than it was in January but where the department is now talking to the ADF about whether there is additional capacity the ADF has, recognising they have other jobs they need to do as well but whether there is some additional capacity the ADF has that they can contribute to the aged care sector. Those talks are happening now. Updated at 6.02am BST 5.34am BST Vaccines do not stop the transmission of this virus The full statement from the chief medical officer has been released, calling on employers to allow work from home arrangements if feasible. Paul Kelly said at the press conference that the statement summarises the advice that he has given to Butler, the other health ministers around Australia and in national cabinet on Saturday charting out what he believes is happening in Australia at the moment and what is likely to happen over the next six weeks. Essentially, my message today is that there is a new variant of Covid-19. It is circulating in the community and it poses a significant new threat. The reason for that is because its much more infectious than earlier variants, this is the BA.5 variant and BA.4 to a certain extent, and its also very good at escaping immunity, whether that is from previous infection so, you can get reinfected with this particular variant or from vaccination. So whilst vaccination, as the minister has said, continues to offer very good protection against severe disease and death... those vaccines do not stop the transmission of this virus, and this variant is unusual in that case. What we do collectively today and what we have in fact already started to do the last couple of weeks will change what happens in the future. We need to do that collectively to the slow the spread of virus as well as to protect the vulnerable and to protect our health systemless which, as the minister has said, are already under strain. All of the recent changes that have been made, the AHPPC statement that was mentioned by the minister, particularly around mask wearing, about working with employers and the community around work from home options, for example, the fourth dose or third dose of vaccine, the increased availability of the antivirals, all of these things together will help to protect the vulnerable and to slow the spread and both of those things are important right now. We know that wearing masks do reduce the spread and protect yourself and protect others if youre away from home and indoors in a crowded place, I really very strongly suggest that you do wear masks. COVID statement from chief medical officer Paul Kelly says health experts are again calling on employers to allow work from home if feasibleWe cannot stop this wave of infections but we can slow the spread and protect the vulnerable pic.twitter.comG5sAAtg2jM-- Josh Butler (@JoshButler) July 19, 2022 Updated at 6.03am BST 5.32am BST 76% of aged care residents have had fourth Covid vaccine, Butler says Butler says the rate of fourth-dose vaccination in aged care facilities is going up. Im pleased to say that rate [of fourth vaccine doses in aged care] is now up to 76%. This will have a dramatic impact on the protection of our most vulnerable members of the community, members or residents of aged-care facilities. However, vaccination rates for children against influenza continue to lag. If I had a message to parents of children under the age of five today, it is to consider getting your child vaccinated for flu. Our vaccination rates for influenza for under five-year-olds are lagging where they historically have been at this point in the flu season, lagging quite considerably. As we know, through tragic experience, children under the age of five, and particularly children under the age of two, are a very high risk category for influenza. About 1,300 Australians have been hospitalised this flu season so far through influenza, and almost six in 10 of those or more than 700 of them have been children under the age of 16. Updated at 5.39am BST 5.27am BST More need to get their third vaccine doses, health minister says The health minister Mark Butler is providing the numbers on uptake of vaccines and antivirals. Just over the past seven days 550,000 Australians have received their fourth dose. The overwhelming bulk of those over the age of 50 particularly between the ages of 50 and 65, which was the new target group by Atagi. I cannot stress the importance of booster doses enough. Two doses of Covid vaccines just are not enough to provide you with full protection particularly against these Omicron subvariants. There are still more than 5 million Australians for whom it has been at least six months since they had their second dose of Covid vaccine but have not yet had a third dose. Over the last seven days only 50,000 or so Australians received their third dose. The third dose rate just isnt shifting fast enough, and I strongly urge people who are eligible for a third dose but have not yet had it to go out and get that booster. It will provide you with extra protection, particularly against the possible of severe disease. Also I can report that the prescription rates for those antiviral medicines have increased sharply in just the very short time since the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee expanded the eligible and provided that every Australian 70 and over will be able to have access to these highly effective convenience and people over the age of 50 who have two risk factors are also eligible for it. Im really hopeful to see those rates of prescription continuing to increase. They will have a dramatic effect on hospitalisation numbers if were able to continue to expand that number. Updated at 5.30am BST 5.23am BST Health minister says real number of Covid infections is likely double that reported The health minister Mark Butler is speaking on the Covid-19 situation across the country. This third Omicron wave for 2022 is proving to be a very, very significant one. There were 300,000 cases or thereabouts reported over the last seven days, and I think the CMO and I are pretty confident that the real number is likely to be more than double that. We are seeing hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Australians infected every single week in this wave. As of today, there are more than 5,200 Australians in hospital with Covid. That number has increased very dramatically over recent weeks. Over the last month or so, its gone from something under 3,000 to over 5,000. People will recall that in January that first Omicron wave, the BA.1 wave, in January saw hospitalisations reach about this number, about 5,200, 5,300. Butler says these numbers are now approaching the figures from the January outbreak but there are two notable differences in this outbreak. He says that in January, Western Australia effectively had no hospitalisations as their border was still closed. The other difference obviously between the situation we confront today and in January is that hospitals are also grappling with flu. A range of other respiratory illnesses and the usual surge in hospital activity that we see during winter. The minister for health and aged care, Mark Butler. Photograph: Morgan SetteAAP Updated at 5.27am BST 5.17am BST Calls for employers to allow employees to work from home due to Covid surge Chief medical officer Paul Kelly says health experts are again calling on employers to allow work from home if feasible. The CMO said on Tuesday. We cannot stop this wave of infections but we can slow the spread and protect the vulnerable. Kelly joined health minister Mark Butler for a press conference at Parliament House - his first appearance of this type in some time. Both entered the press briefing room wearing face masks. In a statement, Kelly said Covid cases would continue to rise over the next month. Butler said the real rates of Covid infection were likely more than double the reported figures. Kelly recommended employers review occupational health and safety risks, as well as business continuity plans. He says employees should consider wearing masks in the workplace. Updated at 10.04am BST 5.13am BST Risks will be influenced by future employment growth, RBA deputy says So where does this leave mortgage holders? Particularly those on the margins Michelle Bullock was talking about (as reported in earlier blog posts). Heres what the deputy governor had to say to sum up her speech: While in aggregate it seems unlikely that there will be substantial financial stability risks arising from the household sector, risks are a little elevated. Some households will find interest rate rises impacting their debt servicing burden and cash flow. While the current strong growth in employment means that people will have jobs to service their mortgages, the way the risks play out will be influenced by the future path of employment growth. This, along with the boards assessment of the outlook for inflation, will be important considerations in deciding the size and timing of future interest rate increases. So basically, it is a watch-and-wait situation. The bank will keep a close eye on how many people are in mortgage stress before making its future decisions on interest rate rises. And just a reminder - the RBA doesnt set your banks interest rate, it sets the overnight cash rate target, which, in its most basic form, is the cost of money for banks to borrow from each other. The banks then take that rate and then adjust their own rates to recoup lossesstay in line with the market. It always seems that interest rate rises are quicker to be passed on than interest rate cuts.

The waves pose the risk of significant coastal erosion. pic.twitter.comCtxF5twwUH-- Bureau of Meteorology, New South Wales (@BOM_NSW) July 19, 2022 5.01am BST Many mortgage holders could face relatively large repayment increases Let me divert your attention for a moment. The deputy governor of the RBA has just gotten to the nub of the matter in her Brisbane speech - how many people does the central bank think will suffer from interest rate rises? Michele Bullock says the bank has done an analysis based on data from its individual anonymised loans from our securitisation database looking at those with a high debt to income ratio loan. For the analysis, the bank has assumed interest rates will rise by 3%. The banks data shows that more than one-third of variable rate mortgage holders have been making loan payments which already meet that target. But just under 30% could struggle, and would face relatively large repayment increases of more than 40% of their current payments. But what about those who have been on fixed rate payments? A lot of those fixed rates which were locked in when interest rates were low and inflation wasnt even considered as a possibility are due to expire mid next year. What does the new world look like for them? Bullock said: Borrowers with fixed-rate loans that are due to expire by the end of 2023 would experience a median increase of around $650 [or 45%] in their monthly repayments. This is slightly more than the rise in payments that variable-rate borrowers would experience over this time.

At the National Press Club, Plibersek has given a major stump speech on the just-published State of the Environment report. Years of warnings, ignored or kept secret, promises made but not delivered, dodgy behaviour undermining public confidence, brutal funding cuts, wilful neglect, laws that dont work to protect the environment or smooth the way for sensible development, all against a backdrop of accelerating environmental destruction. Its time to change that. The minister has said shes still too early in the role - six weeks, as she pointedly reminded reporters - to know what shes going to do about it. But there were some big signposts Plibersek put up. She promised that the Albanese government would deliver new environmental laws by sometime in 2023. There have been calls from many conservation groups to have a climate trigger included in new laws that cover applications for new fossil fuel developments. Plibersek would only say that the starting point on her consultations would be to refer back to recommendations from Graeme Samuel, who reviewed environmental laws last year: He did consider a climate trigger, as some people are calling it, and his view was that there are other laws that deal with issues around climate change including carbon pollution reduction and thats the proper place there ... Im certainly not going to stand here six weeks into the job and start ruling things in, ruling things out, but I would say, to know the direction we are heading in with environmental law reform and reform of the institutions that deliver on those laws, they should start by looking at the work of Prof Graeme Samuel. Updated at 5.00am BST 4.41am BST Still with Michelle Bullock and the RBAs predictions about how mortgage holders will handle increasing interest rates - it all depends on how much you have borrowed as well. Bullock mentioned that the later you bought, the more vulnerable you were to the interest rate increases. Part of that reasoning is because of the increase in the housing market itself. While the value of homes compared to the loan for many mortgage holders is a protection from interest rate rises (to some extent), those who bought at the height of the market dont have that equity protection. Bullock said: The increase in high-DTI [debt to income] borrowing is one area that raises concerns about risks as interest rates rise. While lending standards have generally improved over recent years, the latest housing cycle saw a significant increase in the share of loans at DTI ratios above six, partly reflecting the very low interest rates at that time and hence the belief that the debt-servicing burden of these loans was manageable. On the face of it, such loans are more risky than loans at lower DTIs. If the borrower were to experience a fall in income or an increase in expenses, they might find it more difficult to service the loan. And in an environment of increasing interest rates, there is a risk that households with high DTIs will find it more difficult to service their debt. Updated at 4.51am BST 4.39am BST Deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia delivers speech At the same time as Pliberseks speech, Michelle Bullock, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is in Brisbane delivering a speech on how the central bank sees rising interest rates playing out for home owners. Now, it was not that long ago that Bullock was speaking about Australias very buoyant housing market. You know - nine months ago, when the RBA was envisioning it would be locking in the historic low 0.1% cash rate target until 2024. But that was a different world. Since then, inflation fears have led to interest rates increasing, meaning home owners are facing higher payments, so the RBA has turned its attention to how it thinks mortgage holders will cope. Its mostly focused on the third of indebted home owners - those who hold mortgage debt. You wont be surprised to learn that the RBA thinks most of that cohort will be able to handle the increase in payments. Its reasoning is there are still a higher than usual level of savings from the pandemic, and while debt may be high, the value of the assets (the houses) is higher (in most cases). Plus, Bullock is heartened by the tighter lending controls from the banks since the royal commission. But that is all in the aggregate. As always, the story is in the margins - and those who sit on the outskirts of the aggregate. And for them, the story is not quite as rosy. And in this case, the margins are homeowners in the bottom 20% of incomes, or first home owners. As Bullock said: Highly indebted households are especially vulnerable in the event of a loss of real income through higher inflation, particularly if combined with rising interest rates, and a decrease in housing prices. Recent borrowers are more vulnerable than earlier cohorts, as they are more likely to have borrowed at high DTIs [debt-to-income ratio] have had their serviceability assessed at lower interest rates (albeit with larger interest rate buffers) and have had less time to accumulate equity and liquidity buffers. Government policies to improve housing market accessibility for first home buyers (FHBs) during the pandemic also means that FHBs are more highly represented among this group of recent borrowers than they are in earlier cohorts. Historically, FHBs have tended to have persistently higher LVRs [loan-to-valuation ratio] and lower liquidity buffers than other borrowers, making them more vulnerable to a given house price or cash flow shock. So the less you earn, or the later you bought, the more likely you are to be affected by rising interest rates. Michele Bullock, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Photograph: Diego FedeleAAP Updated at 4.56am BST 4.32am BST Environment v budget recovery Plibersek drew laughs after being asked if she wanted to continue, as more journalists had questions. Plowing on, she is asked if environmental reform was high on the list of priorities considering Australia is nearly a trillion dollars in debt: I think its very high on the list of most Australians to have a clean and healthy environment they can hand onto the kids and grandkids. We have already made substantial investment announcements, including, as I mentioned, $1.2bn over coming years to restore and repair the Great Barrier Reef, money for threatened species, money for recycling, Indigenous protected areas, Indigenous rangers, Landcare rangers, there is a list of commitments we have made that we will fund. We made those promises before the last election and we will fund those promises and they will deliver good results for the environment. The other thing I would say about this, as part of this, is about getting economic settings right. In coming years we see a desire from business to invest carbon credits, if we make carbon credits have the dual benefit of protecting and restoring biodiversity, then we get an environmental return out of the business decision that Australian businesses want to make anyway. They want to say to the shareholders, not only are we reducing our carbon pollution liabilities, we also are investing in the environment because we know that our customers and shareholders care about that stop. Updated at 4.35am BST 4.28am BST Too soon to talk about logging bans, Plibersek says Guardian Australias Josh Butler has stepped up for the next question, following up on the logging question earlier, asking Plibersek how logging can continue after the Samuels report: I understand why people are super keen to be talking about specifics on regional forestry agreements and other areas. It is way too early in the term of the new government ... to be doing that. I am six weeks into this job, we are six weeks into a new government. We need to talk to state and territory governments, in detail, about some of the land-clearing issues that we face as a nation. We need to consult widely on legislative reforms that we might propose. Im not going to preempt those discussions by making individual comments about issues like that. Updated at 4.33am BST 4.23am BST Plibersek asked if emissions targets should be reviewed Next up, Plibersek is asked if Labors emissions targets should be reviewed in light of the shocking Samuels report: I think this report would give anyone who reads it, very strong message that we need to do better the environment. I dont think the only way we do better on the environment is about, its not just about the size of the land or water we protect, thats an important part of it is, its about having a representative block of ecosystems we are covering, choosing areas that are most vulnerable and most precious, so its not our proposal to go beyond the target of 30% of land but, that doesnt mean we dont have really high ambition to protect beautiful, unique, vulnerable ecosystem. Tanya Plibersek is asked whether Labors emissions targets need updating in the light of the Samuels report. Photograph: Mick TsikasAAP Updated at 4.28am BST 4.21am BST A lot of consultation to be done on form of federal EPA Plibersek is next asked about the EPA, and her seemingly important decision to not say the word independent before it. The question goes on to ask if balancing the environment and the economy is a political task. Plibersek rejected the description, saying that seeing the balance that way was always problematic, specifically referring to Matt Canavan: We do support an independent EPA, but the design of that, well, there is a lot of consultation to be done before I come back to you with a final design. The specific roles the EPA will have, and the way its constituted. Ill talk to again in a few months about that, Ill release an exposure draft, you will be able to comment and there will be a lot of opportunities for people to make their views known, on the format roles that an appropriately independent environmental protection agency will have. On the other issue, I really disagree with that, you are saying its a political job to balance jobs versus environment and I think thats the problem we have had. I actually think the job of government is to set up laws and institutions that work to meet the objectives that we make public ... The sort of legal changes we need to make, the sort of institutions we need, to enforce any changes we make, the resourcing required to do it - Id actually really like to take the politics out of this decision-making, instead of having people like Matt Canavan running around the country saying never seen a coalmine that I didnt want to make bigger, perhaps we need to thoughtfully assess using the laws and processes we have in a transparent way. Updated at 4.31am BST 4.15am BST Goal of protecting 30% of Australias land and oceans by 2030 Plibersek has vowed an expansion of Australias national estate, affirming the election promise to set a domestic target to protect 30% of land and sea areas by 2030. Our government will set a goal of protecting 30% of our land and 30% of our oceans by 2030. Well explore the creation of new national parks and marine protected areas including by pursuing the east Antarctic marine park. This will be the latest chapter in a very proud Labor story. Labor protected the Daintree, the Great Barrier Reef, Antarctica and the Tasmanian world heritage area, and as minister, I intend to add to that legacy. Updated at 5.06am BST 4.14am BST Question on national standards on regional forestry agreements Next question put to Plibersek is on whether or not national standards on regional forestry agreements need to be addressed before they are due to be reviewed in 2023, considering some species, such as koalas, are listed as endangered. Chuckling at the question, Plibersek said she was still early in her role, and would look at it: Thanks for that question. As I say, six weeks into the job Im not going to start ruling things in or out, and I havent, I havent even begun to do the amount of consultation that I want to do with state and territory governments, with environmental and business stakeholders on some of these big questions. I know those regional forestry agreements are all coming up for renegotiation in coming years, and those conversations with state and territory government will be important conversations to have. I take the issue of threatened species and the risk of extinction very seriously. It was me that listed the greater glider and that is why we set aside a substantial extra amount of funding for threatened species, for dealing with threatened species. I go back to something else I said in the report, this is something that will absolutely need environmental law reform, it will need institutional reform to make sure when we change our laws we are enforcing the law properly and resourcing that enforcement properly. Its also going to need clearer settings for business, industry, philanthropic groups and others doing amazing work and habitat protection and restoration. Its all part of the picture. Updated at 4.19am BST 4.10am BST Covid update in an hour Meanwhile, we are expecting to hear from the federal health minister in around an hour. Getting big 2021 traumatic flashbacks from the health minister announcing a COVID presser with the chief medical officer pic.twitter.comZgwBDkxwZ0-- Josh Butler (@JoshButler) July 19, 2022 Updated at 4.18am BST 4.09am BST Press club questions begin Tanya Plibersek Photograph: Mick TsikasAAP So first question to Plibersek is on Labors 43% emissions reduction target, and if that is enough in light of the Samuel review. The question also touched on whether coal and gas projects under assessment by the government need to be assessed on their emissions and environmental impact. Here is what Plibersek had to say: On the 43% target, we made a promise to the Australian people and we will keep that promise as a government. Im delighted one of the first things we will do as a new government is legislate higher ambition on climate change policies. Im proud of that and, of course, we will work cooperatively with all of the crossbench - and indeed with the Liberals and Nationals - it would be terrific if we got maximum consensus on the carbon pollution reduction target and the other elements of the legislation we are taking to the parliament. But we have to keep our promise to the Australian people. And on the issue of what some people are calling the climate trigger, and environmental laws, Id say, the starting point for the environmental law process that we will be looking at is the work done by Prof Graeme Samuel. He did consider a climate trigger as some people are calling it, and his view was that there are other laws that deal with issues around climate change including carbon pollution reduction and thats the proper place there. Of course, the process of reforming our environmental laws and reforming the mechanisms we have for enforcing those laws, is going to be a really important listening time for me as a minister and Im certainly not going to stand here six weeks into the job and start ruling things in or out but I would say, to know the direction we are heading in with environmental law reform and reform of the institutions that deliver on those laws, they should start by looking at the work of Prof Graeme Samuel. Updated at 4.16am BST 4.05am BST Environment portfolio hand-in-hand with the Labor reconciliation agenda Plibersek says Indigenous knowledge needs to be incorporated in conservation programs and says number of Indigenous rangers will be doubled. Here I see the environment and water portfolio going hand-in-hand with the Labor reconciliation agenda. First Nations Australians have managed this country for 65,000 years and they did it through changing seasons, shifting climates and across radically different environments. These systems of environmental knowledge have been passed down for thousands of generations, and any modern conservation program should incorporate them and thats why the Labor government will double the number of Indigenous rangers, by the end of the decade to 2030 ... and will significantly increase funding for Indigenous protected areas. We will deliver the $40bn of Indigenous water promised by the Morrison government in 2019 but never produced and will make it easier for First Nations Australians to protect their cultural heritage. We have committed to introduced standalone cultural heritage legislation, which will co-design with the First Nations heritage protection alliance. A healthy environment sits at the heart of our national legacy. And it feeds our national soul. Our sense of ourselves, our health as a society is bound up with the health of our land and water. Updated at 4.11am BST 4.02am BST I want to see a plastics-free Pacific in our lifetime Plibersek is highlighting the links between environment and regional partnerships with Pacific Nations. I want to support ... efforts to reduce petrochemical products while working with the states and territories to encourage a circular economy. That means promoting recycling, reusing and repairing as much as possible. We know how important this issue is to our friends in the Pacific. At the UNs oceans conference last month, our Pacific family told me about the impacts that plastics are having on their health, their environment and their livelihoods. Its an area where Australia can forge really strong regional partnerships. As I said to the Pacific leaders, I want to see a plastics-free Pacific in our lifetime. Updated at 4.12am BST 4.00am BST Government to formally respond to the Samuel review by the end of the year Plibesek says to help guide the reform to environmental laws, Im announcing that by the end of the year the Australian government will formally respond to the Samuel review. Well then develop new environmental legislation for 2023. We will consult thoroughly on environmental standards, but in the meantime I want to see an immediate start on improving our environmental data and regional planning. Establishing a shared view around what needs to be protected and restored, the areas where development can occur with minimal consequences. Updated at 4.17am BST 3.58am BST Environmental indicators to be included in the wellbeing budget Plibersek says environmental reform will also allow us to speed up most processes so we can build new housing, construct new projects, lay the roads that connect our communities, better environmental outcomes and faster, clearer decisions. For too long people have seen these goals as mutually exclusive. Theyre not. Theyre not. Good environmental law is also good economic reform. By agreement with the treasurer, the historic wellbeing budget will also include environmental indicators. As the treasurer said recently, its really important that we measure what matters in our economy in addition to all of the traditional measures: not instead of, but in addition to. Because this is not a conflict between jobs and the environment. We have got to go beyond that thinking when we reform our environmental laws. Updated at 4.02am BST 3.54am BST Plibersek announces federal environment agency Tanya Plibersek speaking at the National Press Club. Photograph: Mick TsikasAAP Plibersek has now moved onto the part of the speech where she is discussing the governments plan for change, including establishing a federal environmental agency and real-time data to track environmental progress. In this term of government I will be guided by three essential goals. To protect, to restore and to manage Australias environment. We need to protect our environment and heritage for the future. We need to restore environments that have already been damaged and we need to actively manage our landscapes, oceans and waterways, and the critical places that we have vowed to protect so they dont become run down through neglect. Thats our agenda. To offer proper protection we need to set clear environmental standards with explicit targets around what we value as a country and what our laws need to protect. This will require a fundamental reform of our national environmental laws and empowering a new environmental protection agency to enforce them. We need trust and transparency. Decisions need to be built on good data, to show the public how were tracking in real time. Data that can be shared so we dont keep collecting the same information again and again but instead we build over time a useful, usable, picture of our environment ... We also need certainty and efficiency. This will allow us to speed up most processes so we can build new housing, construct new projects, lay the roads that connect our communities, better environmental outcomes and faster, clearer decisions. Updated at 4.17am BST 3.52am BST The Liberals and Nationals came to power with a mission to put the environment last Plibersek says the previous government wilfully inflicted harm on the environment. There was wilful damage inflicted as well. From Tony Abbott to Scott Morrison, from Barnaby Joyce to Matt Canavan, the Liberals and Nationals came to power with a mission to put the environment last, to repeal climate legislation and to slash emissions reduction targets. They cut funding to the environment department by 40% and they thought that was pretty clever until they saw what it did in practice. Without proper funding, environmental decision times exploded. According to a National Audit Office review in 2020, the average federal decision for a new project was 116 days behind schedule, and of these decisions around 80% were either non-compliant or contained errors. The previous governments funding cuts held back business, they damaged the economy and they undermined practical efforts to protect our environment ... Thats the situation Im inheriting as environment and water minister. Years of warnings, ignored or kept secret, promises ... made but not delivered, dodgy behaviour undermining public confidence, brutal funding cuts, wilful neglect, laws that dont work to protect the environment or smooth the way for sensible development, all against a backdrop of accelerating environmental destruction. Its time to change that. Updated at 4.09am BST 3.48am BST Plibersek criticises Coalitions environment record Plibersek is criticising the previous government, saying their management led to widespread distrust in environmental management. We see from the State of the Environment Report, the previous government was no friend to the environment. Too many urgent warnings were either ignored or kept secret, but there are other failures too. The former government made nice promises but rarely bothered to deliver them. For example, the previous government had a decade to fulfil the Murray-Darling basin plan. Its a good plan, Labor-made. We delivered it and it saved the river system from dying in 2019. But its yet to be fully implemented. By the time the Morrison government left office, they had delivered just two of the promised 450 gigalitres of environmental water - just two gigalitres of a promised 450. And there was no plan to find the other 448 gigalitres by 2024, when its due. The former government promised $40m for Indigenous water, of which they never delivered a drop. The Morrison government made a series of pledges on recycling, pledging that the Labor government broadly supports. I think most Australians would be really shocked to know just how far we are from meeting these targets and that the former government had no real plan for getting there. Again and again the former government behaved in a way that undermined public trust in environmental management. They gave a private charity almost half a billion dollars without tender or process to guide our response to the crisis in the Great Barrier Reef. It actually doesnt matter how good an organisation is. No one should walk in to the prime ministers office and leave with hundreds of millions of dollars they didnt even ask for. For nine years, the previous government oversaw a broken, barely regulated national water market. The ACCC found that it was a market with no rules against inside trading, no requirements to keep proper records. This led to widespread distrust in the system. Updated at 3.52am BST 3.44am BST Global warming multiplies environmental pressures Plibersek lays out some of the key disturbing facts she says are all multiplied by climate change. Warming temperatures have reduced kelp beds along the south-east coast as well as threatening reef habitats and the abalone and lobster industries that they support. At the same time, Australia is experiencing a plague of marine plastics. In Perth, scientists have found up to 60,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre of water. In Brisbane, they found between 40,000 and 80,000. At the Top End, in the Torres Strait and Timor Sea, abandoned fishing gear has been killing marine animals on an industrial scale. These underwater hurricanes of debris are known as ghost nets and theyre strangling up to 14,000 turtles a year, turtles which are listed as threatened. Our waters are struggling and so is the land. As a result of erosion, deforestation, intensive agriculture and climate change, Australias soil is now generally in poor condition and its getting worse. Were losing topsoil, letting it blow away without vegetation to protect it. Making our soil less productive, less fertile and less efficient in holding water which means our agricultural output is lower than it could be. Our land is more susceptible to drought and our soils ability to regenerate and support life is diminished. Australia is one of the worlds deforestation hotspots. Between the year 2000 and 2017, Australia cleared over 7.7m hectares of threatened species habitat across the country. Thats an area bigger than Tasmania. Much of this clearing occurred small increments. In fact, more than 90% of it was never assessed under our environmental laws. When we destroy these habitats and when we dont restore them elsewhere, endangered creatures lose their home that has consequences. In February this year, koalas were officially moved from threatened to endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. This disturbing list is made worse by climate change. Global warming multiplies environmental pressures everywhere. Updated at 3.48am BST 3.39am BST One of the most important documents in environmental science Plibersek says while her predecessor chose to keep [the report] hidden, she believes Australians deserve the truth. The minister for the environment and water, Tanya Plibersek, with the State of the Environment report. Photograph: Mick TsikasAAP Today, as part of my statutory duty as minister, I am publicly releasing the 2021 State of the Environment Report. Its one of the most important documents in environmental science. Every five years, a group of independent experts, some of Australias most respected scientists, a number of whom are with us here today, are given access to the best available tools. Theyre told to show us the full national picture of the health of our environment. Or, as one of the authors put it, take a good hard look at ourselves. This report was delivered to the government last year. The previous minister, Sussan Ley, received it before Christmas but chose to keep it hidden, locked away until after the federal election. And when you read it, youll know why. But while its a confronting read, Australians deserve the truth. We deserve to know that Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. We deserve to know that threatened communities have grown by 20% in the last five years with places literally burned into endangerment by catastrophic fires. We need to know that the Murray-Darling fell to its lowest water level on record in 2019 and that, for the first time, Australia now has more foreign plant species than native ones. Individually, every one of these revelations is dreadful, but its only when you think about the cumulative impact that you begin to get the full picture of environmental decline. Updated at 4.09am BST 3.36am BST Environment a difficult, confronting and sometimes depressing story Plibersek paints a picture of how lucky Australia is for its natural beauty and just how much the country and its future generations stand to lose. Its been just six weeks since I started in this portfolio and on top of the usual mount of departmental briefings, I have used these six weeks to travel to some of the most remarkable parts of Australia, reminding me again how grateful I am to live in the most beautiful country on Earth. And how thankful I am for generations of activists and good governments who have protected our unique national, natural and culture heritage. But theres another story here, too, a difficult, confronting and sometimes depressing story. At the same time, as I have been seeing some of the most beautiful places on Earth, I have been reading the data that tells me that these places are under threat. If we continue on the trajectory that we are on, the precious places, landscapes, animals and plants that we think of when we think of home may not be here for our kids and grandkids.

The First Nations peoples have the oldest continuing cultures on Earth and are the worlds most successful environmental custodians. Theyve managed land and sea country for 65,000 years, and as the minister for the environment and water, Im committed to learning from this remarkable example.

Updated at 3.26am BST 3.12am BST TGA approves Moderna vaccine for children The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved a paediatric dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, which means children aged six months up to six years may soon be eligible for vaccination. The vaccine is already approved for children aged six years and older, who can receive two doses administered at least 28 days apart, and it is also used as a booster dose for adults aged 18 years and older. The TGA said in a statement: As we have seen with children in older age groups, the TGA expects that vaccines for younger children will provide protection from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as hospitalization and death. As with other age groups, the vaccine in children from six months will be administered as two doses at least 28 days apart. The paediatric vaccine is made in the same way as the vaccines for older people, but contains a lower concentration of the active ingredient.The vaccine was given provisional approval, which means Moderna must continue providing information to the TGA on longer term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment. No detail has yet been released on when the vaccine in this age group will be available in clinics and appointments available. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation will now consider the approval and advise on how and if the vaccine should be rolled out to this age group. They will advise the government on what role the vaccine should have in a national program rollout, and how it should be administered as part of that program.

Azimitabar was seriously ill when he was brought to Australia for medical treatment and kept in the hotels between 11 November 2019 and 21 January 2021, initially in the Mantra for 13 months, then the Park. Azimitabar told the Guardian on the eve of his hearing that the ongoing detention was traumatic and continues to haunt him. My dream was receiving sunlight. Something that people who are free, they never think about it. They have this beautiful gift, they can walk and they have sunlight. I was dreaming of this. His case, supported by Amnesty International, alleges the detention was unlawful. In court, barrister Lisa De Ferrari SC, said their case argued that the minister simply had no power under commonwealth legislation to designate hotels as places of detention. She said: We say theres no power for the minister to have done what theyve done in this case. De Ferrari also argued the commonwealth lacked the proper authorisation to spend money on making the hotels places of detention. The commonwealth cant just - under section 61 of the constitution go and set up these places and spend money on them without that expenditure being authorised in an act, and we say that hasnt happened. The hearing continues. Mostafa Azimitabar in front of the federal court in Melbourne on Tuesday.

In evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the former deputy premier John Barilaros appointment to a plum $500,000 New York trade job, Chris Carr, the Investment NSW general counsel, said it was not correct that West had been previously offered the job. It has previously been revealed that the then premier, Gladys Berejiklian, as well as other senior ministers, signed briefs noting West was the successful candidate for the job. But Carr disputed that she had been formally offered the job, saying there were US tax issues that had not been resolved. He said: My understanding is that Ms West was well advanced in the process, but not at the end of it. On Tuesday Carr was pressed on who asked him to provide advice about whether the trade jobs could be made as ministerial appointments. The Investment NSW chief executive, Amy Brown, has previously said she believed the deputy premiers office had asked Carr to provide the advice. However he told the inquiry the request came either from Brown or her chief of staff. He told the hearing he was asked for advice on the appointment of the senior trade jobs on multiple occasions after the positions were changed from cabinet to public service appointees. I did find myself repeating myself.

The Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) has called a four-hour stoppage starting in the first minute of 28 July but it will potentially have an impact in the hours before and after. The union and government remain at loggerheads over a new enterprise agreement as well as safety modifications to the mothballed Korean-built New Intercity Fleet (NIF). RTBU NSW Secretary Alex Classens says the government refuses to sign a deed confirming it will make safety modifications and guaranteeing the cost wont come at the expense of wages and conditions. Rail staff are asking for a 3.5% pay increase and the stalemate has left workers with no choice but to take further action, he said. The government says the new round of action is a tactic to pressure it into agreeing to exorbitant increases in wages and conditions equivalent to 16.5% in the first year. Earlier this month the government had its case against the union dismissed by the Fair Work Commission, after seeking to terminate industrial action, arguing it was endangering life and impacting the NSW economy.

The Nature Conservation Council deputy chief executive, Jacqui Mumford, said: In the six years since the last state of the environment report, koalas, greater gliders, gang-gang cockatoos and yellow-bellied gliders have either been added to the list or had their threat status upgraded. The two most important things that all governments must do - state and federal - is end the logging of our native forests and end the bulldozing of woodlands on farms. Habitat destruction and climate change are the major drivers of this alarming trend. We have lost more than 7 million hectares of bushland since the year 2000. That has to stop. The state of the environment report confirms what the Samuel review has already found - nature in Australia is being flogged and federal and state laws arent up to the job. We call on the government to review the disastrous anomaly of the Regional Forest Agreements which are a huge loophole that loggers are driving log trucks through every day of the week. We welcome Labors commitment to implement the recommendations of the Samuel review of the Commonwealth Environment Conservation and Biodiversity Act that has been gathering dust since it was tabled two years ago.

Emerging Minds leads the National Workforce Centre for Child Mental Health. The groups workforce development manager Daniel Moss said: Family and domestic violence includes physical violence but its also verbal abuse, fear, and control. Children dont have to be the targets of such violence for it to impact their development, mental and physical health, education and community participation. Women exposed to family and domestic violence have a lot to cope with - their own physical and mental wellbeing, the safety of their children, uncertainty, and often fear about the future. We need to be able to support mothers to get support for themselves and their children in times of crisis. While some women will seek support, others will not. Its imperative that practitioners can recognise the signs of family and domestic violence and know how to address the issue and offer the appropriate support and referrals to specialist services, so they can play a role in the early intervention against family and domestic violence related mental health challenges.

Tanya Plibersek, the environment minister, was asked on ABC this morning if she accepts that the crossbench has a point and Labor needs to be more ambitious. I respect the fact that people on the crossbench were elected to deliver action on climate change and our government wants to work with them to do just that. Thats why one of the very first acts of the new government will be to legislate that higher ambition. They want more than the 43% that Labor is offering though. I think its important for people on the crossbench to consider whether they want to see progress or whether theyre going to hold out for perfection and see this opportunity slip from our grasp again. When Labor was last in government we did legislate action on climate change, on pollution reduction, and, you know, when the abbot government came in, they overturned that.

Updated at 11.09pm BST 10.44pm BST We need to pull out all stops now: Hanson-Young on the environment The Greens environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young is speaking to ABC radio about the state of the environment report released today. Hanson-Young says in many ways the report is not shocking, its what scientists and environmentalists have been warning for years. She says there is a wilful negligence on the part of government, particularly the previous government who wanted to put this under the carpet. Hanson-Young says Australia cant keep going on business as usual as the cumulative natural disasters will continue - whammy after whammy after whammy. She says we need to pull out all stops now, calling for stronger environmental laws, stronger enforcement of those laws and for the government to stop approving projects that put the environment at risk.

Thats why its so important that one of the first acts of the Albanese Labor government when parliament resumes will be to legislate that higher ambition on climate action. But we also need to change our laws and change our systems. Weve had some great suggestions, including from Professor Graeme Samuel. When he reviewed the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act he suggested a number of ways to get stronger protections and also incidentally faster decisions on major projects. Theyre not protecting the environment right now but theyre also not meeting the needs of business. Plibersek also told ABC radio that she intended to push to put new Environment Protection Agency (EPA) laws in place. Updated at 10.55pm BST 10.38pm BST Plibersek says environment report sat on former ministers desk for six months The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, was on ABC this morning discussing the the state of environment report released today, which sounds an alarming bell for Australias ecosystems. The overall story is the environment is in a bad state and its declining. If we dont do something to change what were doing now, were going to continue to see the decline. The previous minister, Sussan Ley, received this report in December last year and it sat on her desk for six months. She didnt want to release it. The government didnt want to release it. When you read the report you will understand why. Its a shocking story.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were overrepresented in the exposed group. The authors said that could partly be explained by high rates of violence (including when perpetrators were non-Aboriginal), but also the fact that Aboriginal status increased the likelihood of police involvement. It should also be understood in the context of the multiple disadvantages faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a result of colonisation and not as an indicator of a racial determinant, the authors wrote. Social services minister Amanda Rishworth said reducing violence against women and children was a first order priority for the government. As a former psychologist working in the delivery of mental health care, it is concerning that children who have experienced family and domestic violence are more likely to be diagnosed with a range of mental health issues, including a twofold increase in substance abuse,. It is also of concern [that there is a] delay between police or health intervention for family and domestic violence and a child receiving a mental health service. Rishworth, the minister for women Katy Gallagher and their state and territory counterparts will meet on Friday to discuss the plan to reduce violence against women and children. Amanda Rishworth says the results of the Anrows report are concerning. Photograph: Bianca de MarchiAAP Updated at 11.13pm BST 10.27pm BST Children exposed to family violence five times more likely to need mental health support, report finds The major report, from Australias National Research Organisation for Womens Safety (Anrows), also found children exposed to domestic or family violence were twice as likely to develop substance abuse disorders, and more likely than children who had no known experience of violence to be diagnosed with a wide range of other disorders. The research, led by a University of Western Australia team, found there was an average six-year delay between authorities finding out about abuse and children being put in contact with a mental health service. Anrows says earlier, trauma-informed interventions are needed to buffer the risk of mental ill health for children. The organisations chief executive Padma Raman says children need access to services that are holistic and able to address multiple needs. Collaboration is the key to effective care - and to avoiding the potentially negative impacts of multiple services working in disconnected ways with children and families. Even where there may be no or limited visible signs of mental distress, we should be encouraging everyone in a childs network to take the opportunity to act early and buffer the risk of mental ill health. Children shouldnt have to be visibly struggling with their mental health before the trauma of violence is addressed. Researchers gathered data from WA Police on about 16,000 children who were identified as being born to mothers who suffered domestic violence, then identified thousands more whose mothers were hospitalised with indications of family violence from health departments. They then followed those children until they turned 18, and found 79% of children exposed to domestic and family violence had contact with a mental health service, compared to just 16% of those with no known exposure. Updated at 11.20pm BST 10.27pm BST Good morning! The government is today releasing its shocking state of the environment report, which has found ecosystems are showing signs of collapse because of the climate crisis and habitat loss. The report is a five-yearly independent review that was handed to the Morrison government in December last year. The federal environment minister Tanya Plibersek will later today speak at the National Press Club about how the government will respond to the report. Children are returning to school today in most states and territories amid rising daily Covid case numbers across Australia, sparking a blitz of measures. Education officials are encouraging staff and students to where masks as term three gets underway. And as Covid case numbers rise, pressure continues to mount on hospitals with 8,500 medical staff across four states in isolation.

Nigel Hugill is standing in front of a playground, gesturing past the swings and climbing frame to the park and homes behind. Its a sunny spring day in Houlton, just outside Rugby in Warwickshire, and residents of a large new housing development are making the most of the weather, taking their children to the playground and eating lunch at the cafe. About 1,000 homes have already been built on the 1,200-acre site, as well as a primary and secondary school, with a further 5,000 houses to be added by the time the development is completed, in 15 years time. Urban&amp;Civic - the company Hugill co-founded with Robin Butler in 2009 and which he leads - is the master developer of this project and 13 others across England. That means it takes responsibility for the site from conception and planning to construction by housebuilders and completion. Hugill set up Urban&amp;Civic with the objective of building outside the M25, but within 100 miles of London in areas with the biggest population growth, and therefore greatest housing demand. The company sees these large developments as key to solving the housing crisis, at a time when the government is pushing its levelling-up agenda. *** CV Age 64 Family Married with four children; Hugill and his wife met as teenagers. Education Teesdale school in County Durham; politics degree at Christ Church, Oxford; masters at the London School of Economics in labour law and labour economics. Pay PS1.3m in pay and bonuses in 2020-21, the final year before Urban&amp;Civic was bought by the Wellcome Trust; he says his pay remains at a similar level. Last holiday Two recent ski trips to Val dIsere, where he has a property. Best advice he has been given? A great quote from Merchant of Venice, which is With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come. Biggest career mistake I have been incredibly fortunate. When I went to work for Chelsfield, the alternative was working for Goldman Sachs before it floated. Economically, there is no doubt that would have been my biggest career mistake. Words he overuses Interesting, and structural. How he relaxes My wife would say He never relaxes. However, he adds: I fantasise over the redesign of properly modern hospitals. *** Urban&amp;Civic buys only brownfield sites in key commuter locations - such as Houlton, once home to the Rugby Radio Station, where the first transatlantic telephone service began almost 100 years ago. Others include a former RAF base at Alconbury in Cambridgeshire,, - the companys first scheme, begun in the depths of recession - as well as sites in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. The centrepiece of the Houlton development is the secondary school, attended by 180 year 7 pupils since it opened in September 2021. It was built around the radio stations Grade II-listed buildings, including the transmission hall and the power room. The 64-year-old Hugills enthusiasm for the project is clear as he bounds up the stairs of the main building, declaring this, the third secondary school he has built, the best so far. Just look at them: theyre feeling right at home here. I love seeing it, says Hugill, catching sight of some pupils. Hugill is no stranger to superlatives: he reels off a dizzying array of fact and figures about Houlton - a joint venture with Aviva Investors - and Urban&amp;Civics other projects. One colleague, who has worked with Hugill for 15 years, describes him as someone who cares about the details, and has an ability to think five to six steps beyond what others are obsessing about. Though he grew up in the north-east, and secondary school in Barnard Castle - which he jokes has now been made famous by Dominic Cummings - Hugills work wasnt always focused on Englands regions. He left home to study at Oxford University - the first pupil from his school to go there - before heading to London for a masters degree and then a first career in banking. He entered property after joining the small developer Chelsfield, becoming its boss and then, when it floated, chief executive of a listed company at 35. During this time, along with a stint at Australian-owned property firm Lendlease, Hugill began to shape the capital - the city he has now called home for more than four decades, although his County Durham roots are still audible in his vowels. The two London shopping centres owned by Australian company Westfield in the east and west of the city, as well as the transformation of the unloved former industrial area around Stratford into the athletes village for the 2012 Olympics, were among the large regenerations projects Hugill and Urban&amp;Civics co-founder Butler worked on. This track record was probably partly why Urban&amp;Civic was acquired by medical research charity the Wellcome Trust in 2021 as part of its investment portfolio, which Hugill says will help the business grow while giving it further political credibility. These developments in the life of the company come at a time when planning rules have again returned to the headlines, as last weeks Queens speech proposed allowing more local input into planning. Since his time advising Sir Bob Kerslake at the Homes and Communities Agency, Englands former housing and regeneration body, Hugill has been convinced that the contribution of large new settlements or urban extensions, or local authorities electing to put a lot of new houses in one place is essential to cope with population growth in south-east England. He believes so-called infill developments, where houses are built in undeveloped parts of existing settlements, wont create anything like the number of homes needed. The governments new levelling-up bill, including measures designed to placate Conservative voters in red wall seats won from Labour in the 2019 election, all points towards a pragmatic outcome in south-east England with more big sites, he says. Which is just what Urban&amp;Civic specialises in. New homes in Houlton. Photograph: Richard SakerThe Observer The newfound flexibility of the post-pandemic world of work has also made Rugby and other regional towns more attractive, and given families the impetus to move out of London. Such relocations pushed sales 30% above expectations during the pandemic. Quite a number of people in Rugby work in London, notionally. They used to commute five days a week and there is no chance of them going back to that if they have a choice, Hugill says, adding that more time and money spent in your neighbourhood helps the whole sense of your identification with a locality. Houlton is four miles from Rugby train station, accessible using the new link road built by Urban&amp;Civic, and it is already served by a bus route. Commuters are clearly a target market: a large poster urging people to join our growing community is prominently displayed in the station car park. This shift will boost local economies, he believes, as flexible workers spend money locally during the week, not just at weekends. However, he offers a caveat: You have to be careful about overestimating the change resulting from working from home, because it is basically only a middle-class choice. Home working also has its downsides, especially for city centres and the small service businesses - from sandwich shops to dry cleaners - which rely on trade from office workers, something which preoccupies Hugill in his other role as chair of the Centre for Cities thinktank. Fridays are looking quite vulnerable, he says of post-Covid working patterns, with many office-based staff choosing to end the week at home. Despite this new workplace flexibility, he believes labour relations are about to be put to the test: At the moment, people are getting paid the same, and getting London weightings and everything else, and that will not sustain over a period. True to his County Durham roots, Hugill would like to see levelling up in action, but doesnt believe this is achieved by merely building more homes in the north of England, or by moving government jobs to different parts of the country. You cant create local economies just out of housing, he says. However, post-pandemic working patterns may also form part of the answer. More home working will, over time, reduce to some extent the London-centric nature of the UK economy, Hugill says of the capital. But its more than capable of looking after itself.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2023\/mar\/19\/stay-at-home-motherhood-being-undermined-says-senior-tory-mp","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2023\/mar\/19\/stay-at-home-motherhood-being-undermined-says-senior-tory-mp","DATE":"2023-03-19 16:37:04","PLAIN_TEXT":"A senior Conservative MP has said stay-at-home motherhood is being undermined by the governments push to get parents back into work, saying womens natural nurturing role should be valued. George Eustice, the former environment secretary, said he believed the chancellor Jeremy Hunt had focused too much on encouraging mothers of young children into employment and not enough on incentivising them to stay at home. But his comments that men and women were biologically wired differently were described as outrageous by critics, who said they were unscientific and based on outdated gender stereotypes. Eustice, 51, is one of a number of Tory backbenchers who are now pushing Hunt to cut taxes for families at the next fiscal statement, likely to come in the autumn. But his comments have been criticised by opponents as out of date and insulting to modern families. Stay-at-home mother is now almost used as a derogatory term, Eustice said. We should respect the choice that women make. He said that he was focused particularly on encouraging women to stay at home rather than men because mothers have a unique bond with young children. Many women do want to spend those first few years with their child, he said. Its a short period in life where they can perform that natural nurturing role. We shouldnt belittle it, we should value it. He added: I think [motherhood and fatherhood] are different and we should be honest about that. Fathers of course have a very strong paternal desire to spend time with their children but you cant get away from the way we are biologically wired and the maternal instinct is a strong one. It is generally the case that mothers in particular will want if they can to spend that time with their young children. Adrienne Burgess, chief executive at the Fatherhood Institute, said: George Eustices comments are completely out of date and insulting to modern families in which fathers aspire to be central to their childrens lives. Research has shown that paternal instinct is no less powerful than maternal when fathers caretaking is acknowledged and supported. Dr Anna Machin, one of the UKs leading evolutionary anthropologists and author of The Life of Dad, called the MPs comments outrageous and ignorant. She added: Men want to stay at home with their kids just as much as mothers and they are just as good at it. It is society, culture and in particular a lack of support from government which prevents them. Eustices comments are also at odds with Hunts push to get as many people back into work as possible, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. The chancellor told the Commons during last weeks budget: For many women, a career break becomes a career end. Our female participation rate is higher than average for OECD economies, but we trail top performers like Denmark and the Netherlands. Eustice believes, however, Hunt is focusing too much on maximising economic growth rather than protecting traditional family structures. The relentless pursuit of GDP is a rather flawed, somewhat artificial measure of growth, he said. Joeli Brearley, founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said it was absolute nonsense to say that women were more natural caregivers. I would agree wholeheartedly that we must respect the choices women make, she said. The issue is that mothers are not currently enabled to make choices. Eustice is one of a number of Tory MPs who are now pushing the chancellor to change the tax system so that parents who stay at home and do not earn a wage can transfer more of their unused tax allowance to their working partners. Ranil Jayawardena, another former Tory environment secretary, said during last weeks budget debate: Instead of a one-size-fits-all system from Whitehall, families should be able to decide what works for them ... indeed - a radical thought - one parent could even choose to stay at home, allowing the other to work extra hours, if that is what they want to do. Those MPs say they will not vote against the budget later this week, but they are hoping to put pressure on the chancellor ahead of the autumn statement.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/may\/02\/staff-london-law-firm-can-work-from-home-full-time-if-they-take-20-per-cent-pay-cut","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/may\/02\/staff-london-law-firm-can-work-from-home-full-time-if-they-take-20-per-cent-pay-cut","DATE":"2022-05-02 13:13:34","PLAIN_TEXT":"Staff at a top London law firm have been told they can work from home permanently - but they will have to take a 20% pay cut. Managing partners at Stephenson Harwood are offering lawyers and other staff the option as City firms try to move beyond solely office-based working in a post-pandemic cultural shift to flexible and remote models. Junior lawyers at the company have starting salaries of PS90,000, meaning anyone taking up the offer would lose about PS18,000. Stephenson Harwood, one of the top 50 highest earning legal firms in the UK and with its headquarters in London, employs more than 1,100 people and has offices in Paris, Greece, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. A spokesperson for the firm told the Times that the new working policy would apply to staff at its London office and most of the companys international offices. Partners will not be eligible, though. Full equity partners receive an average of PS685,000 annually. The new salary sacrifice for full remote working policy is being introduced after the companys experience of recruiting lawyers during the coronavirus pandemic who were not based in London, where living costs tend to be higher. However, the company said it expected only a few staff to take up the full-time work from home option because for the vast majority of our people, our hybrid working policy works well. Staff already have the option of working remotely for two days a week. Like so many firms, we see value in being in the office together regularly, while also being able to offer our people flexibility, the spokesman said. While many firms are looking at ways to entice workers thriving on flexible and remote working to return to the office, Airbnb has moved in the other direction, announcing that its staff can live and work anywhere they want. On Thursday, Brian Chesky, Airbnbs co-founder and chief executive, tweeted that employees could work from anywhere in the country they live without having to take a pay cut. In addition, he said staff had the flexibility to to live and work in 170 countries for up to 90 days a year in each location, as part of a plan that will also involve most staff connecting in person for about a week every three months.

With millions of people back in the office for at least part of the week, experts say you can now claim tax relief for working from home only if you meet strict conditions. Some commentators are urging employees to check their PAYE tax codes, because if HM Revenue and Customs has included the relief when you are no longer eligible you could potentially end up with a surprise tax bill. But one bit of good news is that if you were required to work from home but did not get round to claiming, it is not too late. You can still claim for previous years. Tax relief linked to working from home predates the pandemic - it was introduced almost 20 years ago. However, in 2020 the government relaxed the rules, which meant suddenly millions of people who were forced to work from home during lockdowns were able to claim tax relief worth up to PS125 a year. In autumn 2020, HMRC launched an online portal for employees to make a claim without having to provide receipts or do complicated calculations. And, to make things even easier, eligible workers could claim a full years entitlement even if they had to work from home for only one day during the tax year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it has been a popular tax break. Millions of people have successfully claimed it, sending the bill for the relief soaring from about PS2m a year before the Covid crisis to nearly PS500m over the two years of the pandemic, according to reports.Some people were probably expecting they could just claim again. The tax relief was offered to workers provided they were told by their employer, rather than chose, to work from home, and provided they did not receive home expenses payments from their company. Once the application was approved, the portal adjusted the individuals tax code, and they received the tax relief directly through their salary. Your claim was based on the assumption that you incurred costs of PS6 a week while working from home, so you got back the tax that you would have paid on that sum. For basic-rate taxpayers the relief was worth 20% of the PS6: PS1.20 a week. Higher-rate taxpayers could claim 40% of the PS6: PS2.40 a week. Over the course of the year, this meant people could reduce the tax they paid by PS62.40 or PS124.80 respectively. The relief relates to household costs such as gas and electricity, metered water and business phone calls, though under the rules, you cant claim for the whole bill, just the part that relates to your work. Tax experts say the rules have not changed. Instead the gradual easing of Covid restrictions means that most peoples circumstances have. As a result, HMRC has updated the guidance to make clear that you cannot claim the relief if there is an element of choice in your working from home. Joanne Walker, a technical officer at the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, says the rules were relaxed for 2020-21 and 2021-22 in favour of employees, but as of April this year, HMRC was following the rules fully again. She says that, as before Covid, people can now only claim the tax relief if they met the conditions set out in HMRCs Employment Income Manual 32760. These rules are quite strict: for example, it must generally be the case that no facilities for doing your work are available to you on your companys premises. Robert Salter, a client tax director at accountants Blick Rothenberg, said recently that employees should check their tax codes to see if HMRC has included the relief. If this is the case, unless they are still eligible for the relief in 2022-23, they should contact HMRC to get the notice of coding corrected. Otherwise they will have additional tax to pay at the end of the tax year, he said. He added that the work-from-home relief was available from 6 April 2022 onwards only if your employer specifically required you to work from home - for example, to stop the spread of Covid or because your job had been relocated and was now contractually regarded 100% as a home-working role. If, for example, your employer simply now allows staff to work flexibly - ie, being in the office or working from home as it suits each individual - the home office relief ceases to be available for the 2022-23 tax year.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/21\/year-home-office-asylum-interview","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/21\/year-home-office-asylum-interview","DATE":"2022-09-21 11:00:27","PLAIN_TEXT":"Last month, my wife and I learned that we are having a baby boy. I feel really glad, so grateful, but at the same time, I want everything for him. Its been more than a year since my interview with the Home Office and I have heard nothing: I still dont know if we will have permission to remain in the UK. Its frustrating when you have presented so much evidence, so many documents, and you know they have all the information to make a decision. Until they do, though, I dont have permission to work - and we are still living off the PS80 a week we receive in asylum support. Now that we have a new prime minister, were watching the news, reading up on the new cabinet, looking at any speeches that could show what their policies towards asylum seekers may be. Will the new government make the processes faster or slower? Were dependent on them for access to the NHS, to accommodation, for our sons education and healthcare, for everything. Earlier this year, with the first talk of transporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, I realised how quickly things can change. Part of my heart was thanking God that we hadnt crossed the Channel illegally so it wouldnt apply to us. The rest of my heart went out to the poor people who have risked their lives to come here, a country they believed to be safe, only to be told they now face going to Rwanda - somewhere they may know nothing about. For me, this would be terrifying. Related: Fridges are expensive. This winter I may have to finally turn mine off | James Every week, its harder to live within our budget.

Bread is probably not so healthy, but at least it makes you feel as if youre full. Last week, my wife and I started back at college for our English and maths classes. The four-day passes for the buses cost us PS20. It meant we couldnt put anything aside to save for the glasses that we both need - we think they will cost us PS95 each. So for now, I have to sit at the front of the class where I can see, and try not to flag down the wrong bus because I cant read the numbers on it! Going to college is one thing that we cant give up. We have accommodation, were not allowed to work at the moment, and we dont pay energy bills - but I can see how hard it is, how everyone is suffering. Its like standing on a beach where things appear calm, knowing a tsunami is approaching and youre going to be in big, big trouble. If I am given leave to remain here, we will need to find a home, Ill need to find a job that will pay all the bills, Ill need to support my family. I can see how hard it will be, but in my country, my family always worked hard. My parents were both teachers. My father actually had three jobs: teaching in a school, driving the school bus home and working as a tutor in the evenings. I hate to think of my son growing up and seeing me like I am now, as someone who doesnt work, who doesnt bring home the food, who sits around waiting for the result of his asylum claim.

If you wake up feeling unwell, you make a decision about whether to go into work. Maybe your company doesnt pay sick leave, or youve got so much work that itll pile up. Or you just want to work. These are what we call attendance demands. When Ive recently interviewed people, theyve weighed up those reasons, and decided to work from home if feeling unwell. So its not on their sick record, and the organisation knows youre doing less but are glad to get some work. So its win-win. Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazines biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights. But surely in the long run the employee is just making themselves sicker?Depends. If people have chronic conditions and the organisation can be flexible, it helps those people stay in work when they wake up under the weather. We do know that going into work while sick has negative consequences. In longitudinal studies, theyll get the same workers and test them at two or three points in time. And if people have gone to work while sick, they may be at an increased risk of sickness absence in the future: so they are deferring their sickness absence. Theres also evidence around mental health. One study found that sickness presenteeism could increase the risk of depression among people who were not depressed. The issue is that we have lots of research on working from home, and lots on sickness presenteeism in workplaces, but we dont yet have research into the impact of sickness presenteeism while working from home, because this situation is new. I reckon well start seeing that next year. So I have to wait before jumping to any conclusions? No fun! Also Im worried about a culture developing where you cant just be sick in bed.Yes, I have seen - anecdotally, so I dont know how widespread this is - people saying there is an expectation to do Zoom meetings with Covid. For some people, Covid is terrible while others can work through it. All illnesses can hit in different ways. Its about managers and organisations working with people to produce a fairer, supportive workforce. Related: Are knock-off fashion dupes unethical? We ask an expert See, that concerns me, because while some companies do the right thing, there are so many that wont.Yes. I mean, people have told me about going to work with ridiculously serious illnesses. Ive been shocked. Oh really? Like what?I interviewed a guy who went to work the day after a heart attack, despite having pains and not feeling well. He only worked for a short while, because he ended up in hospital. * Join Coco Khan, Tim Dowling and more on 29 June as they share the joys - and pressures - of writing for Saturday magazine.

The move is seen as a clear sign that the department is doubling down on Suella Bravermans suggestion that people are gaming the modern slavery system and that victims of the crime are no longer being prioritised. The previous safeguarding minister, Rachel Maclean, had modern slavery on her official list of ministerial responsibilities but her successor, Mims Davies, has no mention of the crime on her list. Instead, modern slavery is listed at the bottom of the illegal immigration and asylum brief of immigration minister Tom Pursglove. Under Theresa May, the government pledged to be world leaders in combating modern slavery but Braverman said last week that trafficking claims from people gaming the system were derailing the UKs policy on illegal migration. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: The largest single group of modern slavery victims under the referral system last year were British children - including those who were exploited through county lines. Related: Watchdog disputes Bravermans claim modern slavery laws being gamed The evidence shows the majority of exploitation takes place in the UK rather than across borders. The government should be treating this as an enforcement and safeguarding issue and taking stronger action against the crime of modern slavery wherever it takes place. Charities working with victims say characterising the crime as an illegal immigration issue is dangerous. More than a quarter of all people identified as potential modern slavery victims are British, according to official statistics. Olivia Field, head of policy at the British Red Cross, said: Modern slavery is a crime that can impact people no matter where they are from or where they are in the world. From our work supporting people who have been through horrific experiences including sexual exploitation and human trafficking, we know there are urgent improvements needed to better protect and support survivors. So it doesnt become any harder for people to get the help they need, we would urge the lens on tackling modern slavery to be a safeguarding one focused on protecting people impacted by this crime, as opposed to being treated as an immigration issue. Despite Bravermans claims of people gaming the system, 97% of all modern slavery referrals concluded in the first half of this year were confirmed as genuine by the authorities. The home secretarys comments were contradicted by the chief executive of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, Elysia McCaffrey, who said: We dont see people gaming the system ... What we see is vulnerable people who are being exploited by opportunists and criminals. Kate Roberts, head of policy at Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: Modern Slavery is a serious crime which is carried out against individuals and to see it as an immigration matter is wrong and is risky. Preventing and addressing modern slavery should take a person centred approach - starting with safeguarding and ensuring the rights of potential victims. While restricted or insecure immigration status can be abused by exploiters who use immigration detention as a threat against seeking help from the authorities, this is only one of many tools traffickers use, as evidenced by the fact that many British people are victims of trafficking. In another sign that the government is no longer prioritising tackling the crime, there has been no independent anti-slavery commissioner in post since Sara Thornton left in April, despite it being a legal requirement since the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act in 2015. A Home Office spokesperson said: We are committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and in the UK we have a world-leading response. However, it is clear people are abusing our system when they have no right to be here, in order to frustrate their removal.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/apr\/02\/home-improvements-how-to-pay-building-work-prices-rise","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/apr\/02\/home-improvements-how-to-pay-building-work-prices-rise","DATE":"2022-04-02 06:00:43","PLAIN_TEXT":"Since the first lockdown eased, many homeowners have wanted to improve their properties. The race for space has made loft conversions and extensions popular, while some of those who cannot make structural changes are considering how to remodel their homes. Most people have been working or otherwise spending significant amounts of time at home and, probably for the first time, really getting to know why and how their existing home wasnt working for them, says Sam Levene, a director of the designers and architects LLI Design. This, together with large stamp duty costs, means it can be a significantly more appetising proposition to refurbish or extend an existing home to suit your wants and needs rather than move. Katy Esdon of Esdon Architecture in Salisbury has been busy since June 2020, when some of the Covid restrictions were first relaxed. We had about six or seven months of being inundated, she says. Its quietened down a bit but has been steady ever since. Her clients generally want extensions and really wow conversions - the company has designed new kitchens and remodelled the downstairs of houses to include playrooms and working from home space. Theres lots of glazing, Esdon says. People are moving away from bifolding doors and are instead looking at structural glazing, large sliding panels or Crittall-style glazing as an alternative. The Rooflight Company says the cost of glass, steel, MDF, timber and more has increased in price since the first Covid-19 lockdown. Photograph: Rooflight Company However, that glazing costs considerably more than it did in 2020. According to Nick Cockayne of the Rooflight Company in Oxfordshire, since the first coronavirus lockdown, glass has increased by 6% to 12% depending on the type, steel has increased from PS950 a tonne to PS1,500, MDF has shot up by 38%, and silicone, timber, stainless steel and aluminium have all increased in price. Painful inflation is not confined to windows. According to the National Federation of Builders, material prices are changing weekly - and are on average 23.5% higher than they were last year. The cost of cement, for example, rose 1% in February, imported timber went down in price by about 20% in the same month but that followed a two-year rise of 200%. The cost of sanitary ware was up 1.9%. Water-based paint went up by 2.3%, while non-water-based paint has risen by 3.1% It is therefore very likely that prices [will] increase mid-build, especially for new-build or extensions, says Rico Wojtulewicz, the head of housing and planning policy at the NFB. Dealing with rising prices Most companies giving estimates for home improvements will advise that prices can change - and, with the situation moving so quickly, some are making sure this is spelled out in extra-large print. Esdon says her practice is being clear with clients about the impact of inflation. Things have got really expensive, she says. Were telling people that you dont get as much for your money as you did two or three years ago. Her company is advising people to put by more than the traditional 10% contingency fund. It works with builders who are asked to give a fixed-price tender for the work. This means there are no surprises, she says. But they are not valid for as long as they were - before, you might have had a couple of months to make a decision but now they are only valid for two or three weeks. A written quote states the price that will be charged for the work the builder has detailed. Photograph: Reeldeal ImagesAlamy A written quote states the price that will be charged for the work the builder has detailed - it cannot charge you more unless you later add jobs or change the specification of the materials being used. Make sure that everything you want is included at the outset, if possible. If prices keep rising, things that you add later may come at a higher cost than you anticipate. A builder might not be willing to give a written quote for a job that will be done some months in the future or may make it clear that the quote is only valid for a certain period. Levene suggests that if you are responsible for buying anything for the build, where at all possible, if you have out-of-the-way, clean, secure storage at your project, opt to order materials early and store them there. Or, if on-site storage is not possible, negotiate extended delivery dates with your suppliers so you can order something at todays price but have it delivered as and when your project requires it. Most loft conversion companies, for example, ask you to supply the sanitary ware for any bath or shower room you are having installed, so you could buy this sooner rather than later. Another option may be changing the spec of your original design - Esdon says clients are opting for cheaper cladding or different timbers to keep down costs. To add to homeowners woes, there are long lead times for things such as planning permission, which mean prices could rise before you get started. Permitted development rights cover many extensions and loft conversions now, so this will not be an issue for everyone. But if you live in a conservation area or are doing work not covered by the rights, you may have a long wait. According to the planning, architect and builders company Studio Charrette, case officers at some local authorities are struggling to get through a backlog. As a result, the timeframe for consumers to get started on their projects, if they have applied to the council for permission, is in excess of three months, it warns. Paying for it More people are weighing up how to remodel their homes. Photograph: Richard GoodingLLI Design The good news is that despite recent increases to the Bank of England base rate, borrowing through personal loans and remortgaging remains historically cheap. Personal loans of up to PS50,000 are available and can be arranged over a term of one to eight years, says Andrew Hagger, a finance expert at the website MoneyComms. If youre looking to borrow PS20,000 over five years, for example, you can still get rates as low as 2.8% APR with a monthly repayment of PS357 - however, youd need a pristine credit record if you want to bag those best-buy rates, he says. Larger loans cost more. Hagger says borrowing PS35,000 over seven years starts from about 6.7% APR, which means monthly repayments of about PS520. Those rates are fixed, so you do not have to worry about repayments increasing in future months. Credit cards can be a smart way to pay for home improvements MoneyComms Andrew Hagger Its usually easier and quicker to borrow from your own bank as it should have all your financial details and track record to hand; however, dont let that stop you from shopping around - the biggest banks arent always the cheapest, he adds. Some big banks will give you an instant decision and put the money in your account the next day. A personal loan will be easier to arrange than a mortgage, typically. But on larger amounts the rate will be lower, and you can spread the repayments over a longer term. Credit cards can be a smart way to pay for home improvements, especially if youre looking for a smaller sum, Hagger says. There are still cards offering up to two years interest-free borrowing on purchases, from brands such as Barclaycard, Sainsburys Bank, Tesco and MBNA. Its always worthwhile putting an element on your credit card, as this gives you the added section 75 protection should you hit a snag with your builder and the improvements dont come up to scratch, Hagger says. Is it worth it? Glazing costs much more than it did in 2020. Photograph: Andreas von EinsiedelAlamy Yes, if you like where you live and want your home to suit your needs. During the stamp duty holiday, when you could save up to PS15,000 in tax, moving became more appealing to those who wanted extra space. Now that money will go some way towards buying you a basic loft conversion, with no dormer, and you will save the cost and hassle of a move. Not necessarily, if you are hoping to recoup the costs when you move. Jonathan Rolande of the National Association of Property Buyers says that when it comes to return on investment, loft extensions need to add a required benefit to give a return on the very high cost. If a house already has five bedrooms, will a sixth add very much? Not usually. He adds: Double glazing wont add a huge amount - buyers expect a home to have working windows. Kitchens and bathrooms that give a wow factor will help the property sell faster and for more. How much will the work on your home cost? The cost of your project will vary depending on where you live, the size of your home and the scale of the building work, and your choice of fixtures and fittings. The following are guide prices (excluding VAT) for a standard project, taken from the website MyBuilder.com and covering the building work only. Small single-storey extension (3 metres x 5 metres): PS16,000 to PS21,000. Medium extension (4m x 6m): PS26,000 to PS34,000. Large extension (6m x 8m): PS52,000 to PS67,000. Creating a loft room: PS17,500. Loft conversion with dormer: PS45,000. Hip to gable loft conversion: PS54,000. PVC lean-to conservatory (4m x 3m): PS9,000 to PS11,000. Edwardian-style conservatory (4m x 3m): PS10,000 to PS12,000. Victorian-style conservatory (4m x 3m): PS11,000 to PS14,000. Painting (two-bed flat): PS1,500 to PS2,500. Painting (five-bed room): PS3,500 to PS5,000. * This article was amended on 3 April 2022 to clarify that the figures quoted from MyBuilder.com do not include VAT, charged at 20%, and are calculations for a standard build - noting there are many variables within a project that can affect cost.

He vomited all night, until we fell into an exhausted sleep around 5.30am, only to be woken by the church bells next door at 7am, then forced up by the dog whining for breakfast. We wearily started work, cheek by jowl in a tiny space. A few hours later, as my husband started his third speakerphone call of the morning, my noise-cancelling headphones died. Was our dream trip proving to be the stupidest idea ever? We had wanted an adventure to mark our newly empty nest when our younger son headed off to university last autumn. I had a clear idea: the pictures of Venice that circulated in lockdown (silent, clear waters, heart-swellingly beautiful) had filled me with longing. We both work remotely anyway, and the 40m deep dive pool a short drive away sealed the deal for my free-diving-mad husband. We started plotting. Getting there wasnt exactly smooth sailing. Post-Brexit, bringing the dog (too ancient to leave behind) was a costly, stressful hassle. The drive - more than 1,000 miles - took three days, punctuated by tedious recharging stops for the electric car we grew to hate, a cracked windscreen and a tense late-night crawl over the Alps when we realised the Mont Blanc tunnel was closed. The baffled dog decided the car was his home now and refused to leave, having to be lifted in and out, like a Jane Austen heroine. On top of that, shortly before leaving we realised our idyllic-looking, canal-view rental apartment was 48 ancient stone stairs above street level - impossible with an arthritic hound. We panic-chose another from the few we could afford, realising too late it was a single-room studio. Could we survive, confined to one room for a month? It felt like an empty-nest rite of passage. Was our dream trip proving to be the stupidest idea ever? More and more of us are up for these kinds of adventures: one of the few blessings of Covid has been the way it fractured rigid notions about where and when work happens. The digital nomad lifestyle has exploded - one estimate suggests there are 35m currently, and around 50 countries now offer specific visas for those who only need wifi and a laptop to work. Venice is getting in on the act. After arriving, I met Massimo Warglien, a professor at CaFoscari University, who heads the innovative Venywhere project, offering a one-stop shop service for a flat fee, dealing with visa formalities, finding accommodation and workspaces. Venywhere also organises social events and introduces remote workers to local charities and businesses with the aim of enmeshing them within the community. The city is an interesting lab for remote work, Massimo explained - its so small and navigable its easy for nomads to work from museums, cafes, bars, beaches and libraries according to their needs each day. That makes remote work fun. The story is not that people want to work in their kitchen rather than in their office - they want something else. The vomiting turned out to be the lowest point. It was the only low point really, except being mugged by a gigantic Venetian seagull for my sandwich (and that felt like an honour of sorts). We quickly developed a routine - up at 7am with the San Giobbe church bells, coffee, walk the dog, then work, my husband at home, me out. Venice is not designed for remote work - theres a distinct lack of spots to linger, eking out a coffee and using the wifi - but adopting that the city is your office principle made it hugely rewarding. I fell hard for the Querini Stampalia library, a warm, wood-panelled haven on the first floor of a palazzo-turned-museum a short walk from home. Lined with portraits and lit by multi-tiered Murano glass chandeliers, it was a studious cocoon whose silence was occasionally broken, delightfully, by a gondolier singing on the canal outside the window. When it was closed, I tried Massimos tips, working from other libraries and twice from the incredible CaPesaro museum cafe, with its Grand Canal-view terrace with power points and wifi. My librarys silence was broken by a gondolier singing on the canal Work worked, mostly. I did one BBC interview late one night crouched on the bathroom floor (It sounds sort of echoey, the producer said dubiously, are you on speakerphone?) and scheduled a session with Cindy Crawfords life coach during one of my husbands diving sessions. I was only forced to overhear his meetings once after that first time, a surreal experience, I couldnt resist transcribing: We will all sleep easier when the chicken is secured; Were going to dive in to see if there are any choking hazards; and Theres agreement around the room that the carrots are good were my favourite quotes (no, I dont really understand what he does). It helped that, even in winter, Venice is an outdoor city - a place where a post-work stroll, shop and drink can stretch languorously into late evening. We cooked plenty of pasta in the tiny kitchenette and watched Netflix on my laptop, but we also spent cicchetti-fuelled evenings exploring our Cannaregio neighbourhood, or striking out further, then hopping on a vaporetto home. The hardest thing, actually, was convincing myself I was not on holiday. The sun shone all month and ignoring the glittering beauty of Venice at its alluring quietest to focus on my laptop was a regular battle. Mostly the library worked its magic, facilitating a flow I struggle to find even at home. Some days, though, I stared at tourists drinking spritzes in the sun and wished I could join them. When the golden-hour light was too good to miss, I would sneak out of the library for 20 minutes and walk through the kids playing after school in the Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo to watch the sunset on the lagoon. I never do that kind of thing at home, but in Venice, it felt like madness not to. A month was short enough for that carpe diem feeling, but long enough to feel relaxed. We had time not to mind bad meals or abortive outings. And to puzzle at giant, sweet-studded biscuits shaped like a horse and rider in shop windows, discover they were for the San Martino festival, then watch gangs of Venetian children marching through the streets, banging pan lids for sweets. One evening, we joined crowds making the pilgrimage over a temporary bridge across the Grand Canal to light candles in the Santa Maria della Salute basilica for the Festa della Salute. Its a festival commemorating Venice being saved from the plague in 1630 and with many older Venetians still masked in the streets and the scars of Covid livid across Italy, it felt poignant. I bought paper bags of Sicilian clementines, eating them as I walked Walking to the Querini in the morning, stopping for a coffee en route, working in peace, returning through the bustle of the Rialto, then slipping into the dark quiet of Cannaregios back canals, I often found myself saying out loud, wonderingly, I am so happy. I bought cheap paper bags of Sicilian clementines, eating them as I walked, partly because I wanted a sense memory to associate with that expansive feeling of happiness. Now back home, when I pierce a clementine skin, Im flooded with the smell and slosh of water on ancient stone, piles of curly purple and white radicchio at the greengrocer, a 16th-century altarpiece still luminous with life and the garnet glow of a Campari spritz. I had forgotten, in these past few years of mid-life permacrisis work and anxiety and more work, what it feels like to be filled with quiet joy. Venice gave me that back. And how did we get on, loud husband and noise-sensitive, intolerant wife? Brilliantly, really - no blow-ups and barely even a niggle. A month in a beautiful place is no test of a relationship, even in the smallest room. It reminded me how much fun we can have together, and thats nice to remember back home in grey, freezing Yorkshire. What else remains? Pictures - I took hundreds - library cards and a vaporetto pass Im determined to use again before it expires. A new sense of possibility. A healthier attitude to work (lets see how long that lasts). And gratitude, to Massimo for gifting us a lasting sense of connection with the city and his best brioche a la crema tips. To my husband, for being the kind of person who always says yes to adventure. To Venice.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/31\/exercise-fitness-new-year-weightlifting-couch-to-5k","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/31\/exercise-fitness-new-year-weightlifting-couch-to-5k","DATE":"2022-12-31 11:00:15","PLAIN_TEXT":"Exercises you struggle with on a Monday will feel easy by Sunday Emma Kennedy on the Six Pack Revolution I have always been an active person, interested in life, people, news, but after reacting badly to my second Covid vaccine, I developed ophthalmic nerve shingles. It was to affect me for six months and leave me with asthma so severe, I had to learn how to breathe again with a pulmonary physio. My day-to-day existence ground to dust, I found myself interested in nothing. I was overweight, listless and broken, all vibrancy gone. But at the end of 2021 I allowed myself to believe that, maybe, there was light at the end of the tunnel. I had learned to control my air hunger - the sensation of breathlessness experienced by asthmatics - and now, perhaps, with some encouragement, I might be able to put myself on a path back to wellness. My physio told me to start an exercise programme. It was going to need to be full-on, she told me, and I was going to have to commit to it properly. Last Christmas came and went, and I found myself in a barn in Cornwall with my wife: she was scrolling through her phone, I was staring at the wind blowing through a field of grass. Look at this, she said, holding her phone up. They were transformation pictures from an exercise programme called the Six Pack Revolution. They were mind-blowing. Sometimes, things land in your lap right when you need them and, without thinking further, I signed up for the January wave. The Six Pack Revolution is a 75-day food and exercise programme that gradually increases your fitness. It was established by Scott Harrison, a former double-glazing businessman who one day decided to do something about his softening Dad Bod. Youre assigned a group on Facebook, then helped by coaches who will support you when you wobble. There are Zooms with Scott throughout. Fans include Rylan Clark and Sara Cox. For me, starting at a point of absolute zero, it was perfect. First, you know theres a finish line to cross; second, the exercise was going to step up in manageable gradients: in week one youre asked to do 10 push-ups, 10 glute exercises and a range of ab exercises. In week two, that goes up to 20, and so on. These are called dailies and you have to do them six days a week. I chose the Signature programme (PS139), but it has harder courses for people who have a good level of fitness. You will need a battle rope - buy one from Six Pack for PS89.99 (or find them cheaper elsewhere - try mirafit.co.uk). On day one, you cant do 10 push-ups; by the end of the week you can. At the beginning of week two you cant do 20 push-ups; by the end of the week you can. This pattern repeats for 11 weeks until, in your final seven days, youre doing 110. These daily exercises arent remotely time-consuming - at the beginning you can have them done in 10 minutes (towards the end, allow 20). The key is sticking to it. For me, getting my dailies done before breakfast worked best. The great and motivating aspect of the programme is how you can see and feel immediate improvement. Exercises you struggle with on a Monday will feel easy by Sunday, and each week brings new exercises. It never gets stale. In addition, youre given physical challenges every Wednesday and Saturday, which you have to do only once but you can choose to do as many times as you like. The challenges are circuit-based high-intensity interval training (Hiit) and each lasts about 20 minutes. Most of the exercises are done with the battle rope: theres a lot of squatting and using your own body for weight training. Turns out the only thing you need to tone up is you. Bargain. You can easily do everything in your own home: I conducted the programme in my sitting room. I show my day one and day 75 pictures to everyone. I showed them to a cab driver and he then tweeted to tell me he had signed up. Photograph: Courtesy of Emma Kennedy There is no weighing on the Six Pack Revolution. Instead, you take weekly pictures of yourself - you have to show your belly. At the start, its the worst thing you can imagine. I stared at my day one picture and cried. My six-month illness had left me bloated and unhealthy. I looked utterly miserable. There is no way, I thought, Im going to let anyone see that picture. And then, week by week, you watch yourself getting smaller: I was shrinking before my eyes, a waistline started to appear, my shorts were hanging differently, a smile appeared, I looked bright and happy and healthy again. I now show my day one and day 75 pictures to anyone and everyone. I showed them to a cab driver a few weeks ago. He then tweeted me to tell me that he had signed up. The food programme is perfectly manageable: it asks you to eat six meals a day. A typical day might involve eggs and asparagus for breakfast, cottage cheese on rice cakes mid-morning, pan-fried sea bass with garlic and chilli for lunch, chicken shish with baba ganoush for mid-afternoon, sweet potato jacket with chicken for supper and banoffee ice-cream for evening snack. There are loads of recipes to choose from. You can devise your own menu. If you stick to it like glue, youll see phenomenal results. Youll be provided with meal-plan charts. Fill one in at the start of each week and stick to it. Disclaimer: I didnt stick to it like glue (I couldnt eat it all - you wont go hungry) and still saw great results. It boils down to no booze, chicken and fish as your main sources of protein, and no bad white, starchy carbs. Theres also an option to use meal supplements to substitute breakfast and lunch. I sleep better, I feel incredible and my energy levels are through the roof. I cant recommend it enough. Its given me my life back, and the best bit is that, once youre used to it, its so easy to stick to when the programme is done. I do five days of Six Pack and what I like at the weekends. Youd have to be a psychopath not to find violent conflict intimidating. But its also fun Marcel Theroux on Brazilian jiu-jitsu Marcel Theroux (on top) on the jiu-jitsu mat. Photograph: Jon EnochThe Guardian I had wanted to try Brazilian jiu-jitsu for a while before I finally plucked up the courage to have a go. My first exposure to it was through taking my then eight-year-old son to a weekly class. Essentially, BJJ is a system of groundfighting - grappling techniques for controlling and submitting an opponent. Its related to judo, but modern judo stops quite quickly when the competitors hit the ground. With BJJ, getting to the ground is just the beginning. Once theyre there, competitors use an extraordinary range of grips, joint-locks, arm-locks, leg-locks and chokes to submit the opponent. I was drawn to it for a number of reasons. I loved how three-dimensional it was. There was something wonderfully free about the way the kids were encouraged to move: rolling, tumbling, wriggling around on the mats. It made me think how rigidly we carry ourselves as grownups. I was also fascinated by its credentials as a fighting system. Ive always been interested in boxing and Chinese martial arts, and have taken part in both. There are things you can understand only by trying them. There is no striking in BJJ, and it is drilled into practitioners that they have to stop immediately when an opponent taps their hand to signal a submission. This makes it possible to spar in quite a full-blooded way without getting injured. The BJJ term for sparring - rolling - emphasises this playful aspect. When the children in my sons class sparred, it looked like kittens playing. I watched him taking part for about a year before I finally took a deep breath and got on the mat myself, in 2018, just before my 50th birthday. I was quite fearful. I was in OK shape for a 49-year-old. I swam in the lido, did the odd boxercise class and kept up my tai chi practice for balance and flexibility, but you dont see many people my age doing backward rolls, never mind trying to fight their way out of a rear naked choke. My sons instructors, Pedro Garcia and Benny SooTho, also ran adult classes for their club, GFTeam. I loved the movement: it reminded me a little of PE at primary school. I didnt spar that day. I sat and watched, very intimidated, as everyone grappled. It looked extremely intense. Suddenly all that rolling movement is put in the service of getting into a dominant position, locking up your opponents limbs or neck until they signal their defeat with a couple of taps - or, if you dont happen to have a spare hand, saying tap. However controlled the sparring is, and however gentle and attentive your instructor is, there is no getting round the fact that, at its heart, practising BJJ involves violent conflict with another human being. Youd have to be a psychopath not to find that intimidating. But its also fascinating. How would you cope with someone sitting on your chest, trying to cut off your breathing? Or hyperextending your arm so that if you dont tap your opponents hand, it will break? How long do you think youd last? At what point do you give in? I rolled at the following weeks class and it was like being hit by a soft train in pyjamas. I had no idea how to keep my opponents off me. I flailed around and got submitted almost immediately. For the first few weeks, I would sometimes sit out the sparring. But I would then regret not rolling. It felt like going to a restaurant and having only a starter. It turned out that the only thing worse than getting on the mat and being repeatedly submitted was not doing it. Stepping into the gym, choosing to spar and competing in tournaments have expanded my idea of what Im capable of Four years later, I still find sparring intimidating and I sometimes feel a vague dread before class - particularly if Ive missed a few and am rusty. But the reason I keep going is simple: after every single class - even, or perhaps especially, the ones where Ive been smashed by everybody Ive rolled with - I have a rush of endorphins. I feel extraordinarily calm, happy and stress-free. Ive gained strength and flexibility, and lost weight. And I enjoy the companionship of the people who are choosing to undergo the same challenges. We are putting our wellbeing in each others hands and that gives rise to trust and mutual respect. It takes a lot of courage to walk across the threshold of a martial arts gym and participate. I have no idea how long my body will keep up with this, but it has been a transformative experience. Im in better physical shape than I have been for many years, but the more intriguing changes are mental. Those gradual increases in intensity, from stepping through the door of the gym, to choosing to spar, have expanded my idea of what Im capable of. The process acquaints you with your courage. This year, one of my teammates persuaded me to sign up for a competition. Not so long ago, thats something I would never have contemplated. When I calculatedly missed the application deadline, my teammate Heath told me to send an email to the organisers. I couldnt bring myself to say that I was too scared, so I did it and they slotted me in. I was bracketed with people broadly my age and weight, but it was still terrifying. As it turned out, I won both my fights. Then I competed again in November, and lost my only match on points. That did sting, because I had improved, and yet I was still beaten. In the aftermath, I found myself reflecting on grips that I hadnt dealt with, an opening that I hadnt taken advantage of. Its given me another challenge: how to improve my decision-making under pressure. Our senior instructor, Pedro, whos a second-degree black belt, still competes, wins some, loses some, and seems at ease with whatever the outcome. That strikes me as very enlightened. One of the other great joys of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is that I get to train with my now 14-year-old son. We are the oldest and the youngest members of the class, respectively. Of course, its a challenge to keep turning up there, to surrender to the process and not fixate on an outcome, to eat victories and defeats with equal relish, to get comfortable with discomfort and continually accept loss as a teacher, not a verdict. But its also - and this might sound odd - enormously fun.GFTeam are at en.gfteamofficial.com.

Photograph: Sophia SpringThe Guardian In May 2021, I joined a gym. While many put on weight during lockdown, Id lost 9kg (20lb) from walking every evening, no social eating and doing online Hiit classes twice a week. But I was itching to get even fitter. Fitness has its momentum; the fitter you get, the more of it you want. I had seen many strength training clips on Insta of women of all ages pumping iron and I knew instinctively that there was something here. While I had never lifted weights before, I knew it improved bone density, muscle and overall wellbeing. In 2018, a fractured foot led to a bone scan that had uncovered osteopenia (less severe than osteoporosis), common in women my age - and I hoped it would help. I joined a local mixed gym and hired a male personal trainer. Joining a proper weights room is intimidating. It looks like a torture chamber. Actually, it is one. Racks, benches, unfathomable contraptions, dumbbells, kettle bells, barbells - all industrial looking - ropes and pulleys, and buckets of clips, resistance bands and even sandbags. I felt small (these gyms are full of large, muscle-bound men) and men did flirt, incredibly, even with my 57-year-old professors arse. I was stunned. Me? Not cool; not there, where I felt vulnerable and was trying to get fit in private. And so, in November 2021, I found StrongHer, an all-female training gym close to where I live. Strength training releases serotonin, the feelgood hormone. Train consistently and you will feel well consistently Housed under an old railway arch, StrongHer was founded by women (Tig Hodson and Sam Prynn), for women, and its aim is simple: empowering women. The arch is strip lit and catchy music is on at full volume. Its like walking into a nightclub, even at 9am on a Sunday. I tried a couple of high-energy weightlifting circuit classes, but soon realised that all I really wanted to do was work one-to-one. I approached Abi Skipper after attending one of her classes. She is 20 years younger than me, and I loved her huge laugh and positive energy. Finding StrongHer, and meeting Abi, who would become my personal trainer, is up there with those great change moments. Once I hired Abi (personal trainers at StrongHer range from PS50-PS80 an hour), I went off-peak, during afternoons, when its quiet. It was during my one-to-one sessions that I got to clock the other women coming in: women in hijabs, younger women and other women my age, all quietly racking and deracking their barbells. Ive fallen in love with the process of making my body stronger and more flexible. You dont need to lift heavy to do this. The most Ive deadlifted (lifting a weight straight off the ground) is 45kg; the most Ive squatted is about 30kg. I bench 20kg, at a push. In this time, Ive discovered an old injury in my left quad and had it healed by one of the best physios in town. I have learned that getting stronger is fun and fulfilling. And that strength training releases serotonin, the feelgood hormone. Train consistently and you will feel well consistently. From the outside, training might look rather meaningless, even a little shallow. But, trust me, lifting weights boosts the soul. Its an emotional workout, too. And its also not about the dreaded mundane female goal of losing weight. Since joining StrongHer, Ive lost no weight and yet I do look slimmer, or maybe just different. When you train for strength, guess what? You get stronger. My body before strength training was flabby and had lost its lines and shape. Eighteen months in, my arms are firm, my legs are limber, stronger and more shapely, and my arse has never looked better. And yet Im not that light in weight. Im a size 14. Ive gained muscle mass and bone density. In October this year, I also found, through Abi, a great nutritionist, Ellie Geldard. I tried many apps during my fitness journey, from a Fitbit Versa Lite, for tracking steps, to glucose monitor Veri. All have helped me track habits without the dull grind of tracking calories. While Im never going to look like Nicole Kidman, I dont want to. Strength training, especially in an all-female gym, is a feminist choice; its political. My trainer is a woman, the rest of the crew are women, and we set our own pace and cheer each other on. We make each other happy. Win, win.For more information on women-only weights gyms, go to womenshealthmag.com I realised I wasnt going to die that day. And that, if I wanted to, I could run. Was I too late? Christian Donlan on Couch to 5k Christian Donlan: At its best, running is like being loaned someone elses brain. Photograph: Peter FludeThe Guardian I have always envied runners. For years I would watch them scattered along the seafront as I rode into Brighton on the top deck of a bus. Runners captivated me. I envied their cheerful solitude and metronome grace, arms tracing neat rhythms in the air. I envied their focus: they found the time in the daily muddle of work and family to be out here with the sky and the ocean breeze. Someday, I told myself, I will join them. A strange ambition, really. I was never the most active person; I never played sports or learned to swim. Then, almost a decade ago, I got multiple sclerosis. MS is a disease in which the coating of cells in the central nervous system is damaged, disrupting the transmission of messages. It causes symptoms from mild confusion to paralysis, and can affect almost all parts of the body, but it frequently leads to balance problems and muscle spasticity. Not an ideal situation for a runner, although I should add there are great athletes who have MS, such as sprinter Kadeena Cox and 400m hurdler Lina Nielsen. I was 35 when I was diagnosed. I stumbled from GP to specialists, from MRIs to neurology wards. I was lucky, though. With careful treatment, its progress was slowed. MS was not over, but it became something I might exist alongside. In the thick of symptoms, I had felt jarringly, vividly alive; emerging from that, I wanted to make the most of whatever came next. So I woke up one spring morning last year, firmly into my mid-40s, with hundreds of middle-aged worries teetering over me, and I realised with surprise that not one of them had anything to do with MS. I realised I wasnt going to die that day. And I realised that, if I wanted to, I could run. Was I too late? A runner needs a goal. I had a simple vision of my future self lacing shoes, leaving the house, picking a direction and running. No marathons, just running for half an hour, which I read puts you in 5km territory. On a sharp April morning I downloaded the Couch to 5K app. This takes you from not running at all to running for 30-minute chunks in nine weeks: three runs a week, interspersing intervals of walking. It worked, I gathered. My brother and colleagues had done it. With the app downloaded, I pulled on threadbare Converse, which even I was pretty sure werent made for running, a T-shirt and joggers bought for a Halloween party. I headed for a park, the ground squeaky with dew. The first Couch to 5K session is short: 60 seconds of running followed by 90 seconds of walking, repeated seven times. I told myself this was nothing, although I sensed panic building. Would MS re-emerge and flatten me? I tried to empty my head. Warm-up done, I resettled my wifes headphones over my ears and ran. I laughed out loud at first. For those startled opening seconds, my body felt rickety and preposterous. Theres no future in this, I thought, as my legs juddered ominously. Was this MS, or was it years of sitting around? I ran for 20 seconds, feeling like an idiot. Someones going to stop me, I thought. Can you be arrested purely for doing something so obviously out of character? But then I reached my first corner and turned. The rickety feeling didnt disappear, but I suddenly understood that it wasnt anything I recognised from MS. It was movement, speed and the thudding of feet. I was running, each moment feeding the next. The following 40 seconds passed in a rush, and I was annoyed to have to walk for an interval afterwards. This first session rolled on, easy, then tricky. By the sixth interval I was drained, but determined to finish. The joy as I stumbled home, the voluble cheer that I felt for the rest of the day as I chattered mindlessly while my daughter did her homework, was something I was not prepared for. And the feeling returned after the next runs, each preposterous at first, then simultaneously exhausting and exhilarating. I learned a lot in those initial sessions. I got used to the kind, conspiratorial voice of the writer Sanjeev Kohli in my ear, speaking through the app, telling me when to run or walk. I learned the times Id have the park to myself. Also, I was starting to see runs in terms of two halves. For the first half I was cheerful and poised, padding through a Jimmy Stewart world, nodding at postmen and smiling at angry little dogs. For the second half I was sweaty and stumbling, an escaped convict pursued over moors by bobbies with bloodhounds. The task was to extend the first half indefinitely. When, fortysomething weeks in, it happened, success felt fantastic. Actually, I felt a bit sick, but then it felt fantastic As I went on I picked up another app, Strava, which tracks runs and gave me an overview of the tiny distances I was suddenly covering every week: 2.4km, 2.8km. The app turned each run into a visual trail, superimposing my wayward paths on to the landscape I ran through, like seeing my bodys handwriting. But there were other loops. I got visual migraines, arcs of jangling golden lines that felt like a rip had formed in my vision. Familiar since my diagnosis, the regularity of them was new. As I ran, getting steadier and more confident, I would wait for them to ignite. I also started to sense the contours of MS inside me. It wasnt pain, although spasticity could make my calves so tight they felt like nasty little stones glued to my legs. It was more the sense that I was running within a boundary. I could go so fast but no faster. Maybe I would find that I could go so far and no farther. Was this boundary real? I couldnt tell. Three weeks in, my knees started to ache. My wife suggested the Converse had to go. I bought my first running shoes. It felt like a breakthrough: my bad knees had nothing to do with MS. This was just part of running. I had discovered I liked to run, loved the chummy exhaustion and the impact of my feet on the ground. The knee pain had gone and I sensed the special collaboration of exercise: a coming together of all the pieces of me. If I hadnt had enough water beforehand, my throat would tell me. If I neglected my breathing, my lungs would tell me. My body also sent warnings at times. If my balance was bad, Id lurch and stumble. Time to turn back, ceding a temporary victory to MS. After runs I came home frothing with ideas: flavour combinations, books to read, old friends to get on the phone. I wanted to know about oil painting, the names of the birds Id seen and the trees Id passed. At its best, running is like being loaned someone elses brain. By the end of week five I reached a run I simply could not do: 20 minutes, no intervals. The joy was in me, the energy was not; I had outrun my willpower. This is where the weeks started to stretch into months. From week five, I went back to week four, then three. Soon I was stuck, orbiting weeks three and six. Late in a repeat of week five, Kohli told me: You can call me Sanj now. I almost wept. Hed known me for five weeks, so it seemed appropriate to him. But I had known him for 20 weeks. I hated to be out of step with Sanj. Hed compliment my running, but he could not tell when Id stopped and decided to walk. As Id stagger about, defeated, Id hear him say, Youre doing really well! or, Im proud of you! My heart would break a little, as I had lied to Sanj. To get unstuck, I borrowed a trick I had used with MS. Faced with strange new symptoms, I tracked them in a notebook. So I began a running journal, searching for a simple formula for success. W3D3, energy bar, water, music not podcasts. Good(ish). In among the repetitions and intervals, I glimpsed something important. The teetering tower of worries that loomed overhead each morning: couldnt I tackle it in the same incremental way? It was not the complete solution to the problem, but at least it was a start. A friend had told me that mixing running and walking is sometimes called jeffing, named after Jeff Galloway, one of the running coaches who popularised it. Today I jeff my way through many things in life. Related: Move yourself happy! How to exercise to boost your mood - whatever your fitness level And then it happened. Fortysomething weeks in, on one clear winter morning, I ran 5km without stopping. A colleague had recommended parkrun, the 5km meet-ups held around the world at 9am every Saturday. It was a revelation. All of us together. Encouragement and kindness. I was re-energised. Id love to say I barely noticed my first full 5km, but I was calculated in grinding it out. For weeks I stalked that 30 minutes, using my journal to spot the point I got tired, then working out how to get past it. Mantras, the right soundtrack - I used every trick. Success felt fantastic. Actually, I felt a bit sick, but then it felt fantastic. I staggered away, thinking: done. I have graduated. I hadnt, of course. Every run is different. While Id mastered parkrun for a day, solo running still required jeffing. Parkrun still does, too, most Saturdays. But even on a wonky run, I can look around and think how much I did not know when I started. The qualities of the birds. What to do with a stitch. What 10 minutes feels like when you are paying attention to every breath. I find it incredible to think that I have run for 5km without stopping, even if I cant do it reliably. And I find it incredible to think that I have had MS in my life for almost 10 years. I still fall into the bad habit of thinking illness is binary: you were well, now you are ill. But illness changes, and I can see that when I look at it through the lens of running. My first years with MS were all about accepting the rhythms it forced on me. For the past few months, Ive been confident enough to push back, just a little. I started Couch to 5K in April 2021, and I hit 5km in February 2022, which is an interesting response to a nine-week programme. I often marvel at the pleasure I have found in something Im not particularly good at. Struggling with 5km, struggling against MS, or being in my 40s, or just being me, has allowed running to turn into a genuine habit. Hitting 5km without stopping might be a rarity, but Im in this for good. In every sense, Im going to run for as long as I am able to.

They got to spend more time with their families, adopted more pets, enjoyed the magic of delivery services, binged Netflix, swapped their suits for sweats and even started an unprecedented number of businesses. All these reasons - and plenty of others - are behind why so many workers want to continue doing the same, even as we try to put Covid in the rearview mirror. For those employees, heres a warning: prepare for reality. Employers are planning to have you back in the office. Why else would Facebook lease another 300,000 sq feet of office space in New York City to add to its already 3m sq feet occupied? Why would Google be spending $2.1bn on a Manhattan office building and expand its sprawling campus in the city to house its more than 12,000 employees? These are tech companies with businesses built on the cloud ... so why expand offices? And why would Manhattans commercial real estate market be rebounding with CRBE, which tracks these sorts of things, reporting that leasing activity rose 100% year over year as of 31 March? We just hit 95% occupancy, which is the highest occupancy number in the history of the building, gushed one New York City landlord. This is not just a New York City thing, either. In Charleston, South Carolina, commercial vacancy rates are below 2% and almost 10m sq feet of industrial space is under construction. In Jacksonville, Florida, 2021 was a great year for commercial real estate investors, with all product types posting increases in market rent, occupancy and interest from buyers. Northwest Arkansas commercial real estate has its lowest vacancy rate since 2005. In Philadelphia, Baltimore, Santa Clara and Chicago, theres a post-pandemic boom in mixed-use commercial and residential properties under development. Developers in Iowa say that industrial spaces cannot be built fast enough. Office vacancy rates continue to decline in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange county, California. If everyones working from home - as we hear again and again in the media - why is the commercial office space market booming? Yes, theres more demand for warehousing thanks to all those Amazon orders. But its also because of something else: everyone is not going to be working from home in the months to come. Theyre coming back to the office. Sure, the big companies are still slow to bring their employees back. Larger organizations from Goldman Sachs to KPMG - worried about bad PR and potential lawsuits - are tentatively allowing employees to determine their own arrangements. But this is quickly changing. More than half of corporate leaders want their people back in the office five days a week, according to a new study from Microsoft. Even GenZ-ers view remote working negatively! So will these workers return? Theyre not going to have a choice. We know that many employees are reluctant to come back to the office. Just this past week, a study found that more than half of Apples workforce would like to quit their jobs because they prefer working from home. Other studies - like this one and this one - have shown that workers overwhelmingly prefer to keep working from their homes in lieu of commuting. Who can blame them? But as much as employees want to work from home all the time, thats just not going to happen. The reality is that workers at the nations small businesses - who employ about half of our workforce - have been back to the office for a while now. When I visit my clients - who are almost all small to midsized firms - their employees are at their desks. If you dont believe me, take a drive around your towns suburbs and look at the parking lots. Theres no question that work-from-home arrangements are now a core benefit that businesses must provide. My best clients are re-addressing their work cultures and doing their best to offer as much flexibility for their employees as they can allow. But there will be a limit. I dont know any who are going fully virtual and very, very few that are allowing their employees to work remotely for more than two days a week. Thats because employers know that real work gets done when teams can be together, face-to-face, and collaborate, innovate and yes, even socialize. They also know that working from home can be difficult for some, cause loneliness and depression in others and also provide opportunities to avoid the work theyre actually being paid for in lieu of running their side-gigs. Working from home is here to stay. But - judging from what were seeing in commercial real estate - companies are expanding, not abandoning, their offices. Many employers are doing their best to help transition their employees back. But in the end, this is business. And business gets done in a workplace, which means coming into the office - at least most of the time - is a reality that workers are going to have to face.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/dec\/14\/uk-shoppers-and-workers-kept-home-by-rail-strikes-and-cold-snap-data-shows","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/dec\/14\/uk-shoppers-and-workers-kept-home-by-rail-strikes-and-cold-snap-data-shows","DATE":"2022-12-14 14:12:48","PLAIN_TEXT":"Train strikes, a cold snap and snowy conditions have kept workers and shoppers from city centres this week, emptying out high streets and office buildings, figures show. Footfall on Britains high streets and at shopping centres plunged on Tuesday morning as consumers stayed at home, according to research by the retail data analysts Springboard. Separately, office occupancy data showed that fewer workers made it to their desks across the UK on Monday in the face of snowy conditions, but levels attending slipped even further on Tuesday as rail strikes kept many working remotely. London was particularly affected by the decision by office workers and shoppers to stay at home. The two-day rail strike on Tuesday and Wednesday is the first in a wave of industrial action that will affect train travel for four weeks around Christmas. Only about 20% of normal services were expected to run during the strike involving about 40,000 members of the RMT union at Network Rail and 14 train operators, according to Network Rail. Footfall at shops close to offices in central London was nearly 37% lower on Tuesday than the same day in 2019, Springboard found, while across the UK as a whole, it was 26%. High streets across Britain also had much lower visitor numbers on Tuesday, with footfall down a third on the same day three years ago. Coming during the crucial pre-Christmas trading period, other types of retail locations were also affected. Footfall was nearly 28% lower at shopping centres, and was down 9% at retail parks. Diane Wehrle, the insights director at Springboard, said: The impact on retail and hospitality businesses in what is a critical trading time of the year, less than two weeks before Christmas, will undoubtedly be severe and could mean failure for some. Meanwhile, UK offices were considerably quieter on Monday, averaging 24% occupancy, which was 8% lower than the same day a week earlier, according to data from Freespace, a workplace technology company that tracks building occupancy levels. Occupancy levels remained low on Tuesday, which is now one of the busiest days of the week in city centre offices, after rail passengers were advised not to travel during the strike. Average UK office occupancy fell to 28%, down by more than two-fifths on the 47% level a week earlier. London offices were even quieter, reaching just 22% occupancy, less than half the 51% seen on the same day a week earlier. However, the rise of remote working and video conferencing during the pandemic has enabled office workers to carry out their roles even if they are not able to reach their usual workplace. The acceptance of new working patterns has given everybody a newfound freedom to work where they want and how they want; to move the dial between independent and collaborative working as needed, said Raj Krishnamurthy, the chief executive of Freespace.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"technology\/2022\/jun\/30\/us-school-shooting-technology-solution","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/jun\/30\/us-school-shooting-technology-solution","DATE":"2022-06-30 10:00:37","PLAIN_TEXT":"After the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas , an all-too-familiar question emerged: how do we prevent such horror from happening again? A handful of companies have said they have tech solutions that could help. They included the drone firm Axon , which promoted a remotely operated Taser device to be deployed in schools. EdTech companies, including Impero Software, said their student surveillance services could flag warning signs and help prevent the next attack. Related: Really alarming: the rise of smart cameras used to catch maskless students in US schools The companies are part of a thriving school security industry, one that has been forecast to reach $3.1bn in 2021 from just $2.7bn in 2017, according to numbers from market firm Omdia. Its research found that the K-12 school security equipment market specifically was $1.5bn in 2018 and projected it to reach about $1.75bn in 2021. The Security Industry Association, which counts more than 400 companies targeting kindergarten and elementary schools among its members, has spent nearly $2m on lobbying since 2010, according to OpenSecrets.org. Gun safety legislation passed by Congress last week included more than $300m to bolster the Stop School Violence Act, a federal grant program created after the Parkland shooting to fund school security that was endorsed by the industry group. But gun control advocates, teachers groups and tech watchdogs are skeptical increased spending on hi-tech security measures will help curb gun violence in American schools, and in some cases may even cause more harm to students. We are all weeping for the children lost in Uvalde, but some tech execs are chomping at the bit to make money off this tragedy, said Rewan Al-Haddad, campaign director at tech watchdog SumOfUs, adding that some of the solutions arent just unhelpful, they are actively harmful. Days after the Uvalde shooting, Arizona-based drone company Axon announced the development of a remotely operated Taser drone system as part of a long-term plan to stop mass shootings. A Taser drone system, as shown in this computer-generated rendering, by Axon Enterprise was put on hold after it received backlash. Photograph: AP The publicly traded company develops weapon products for military, law enforcement and civilians and has a market cap of $6.87bn. It claims its technology has saved 266,000 lives, but the announcement of its Taser drone created a maelstrom of backlash - leading nine people to resign from Axons advisory board and the company to pause the project indefinitely. In light of feedback, we are pausing work on this project and refocusing to further engage with key constituencies to fully explore the best path forward, said Rick Smith, Axons founder and CEO, in an online statement. The use of drones in police forces has been on the rise in recent years, with at least 1,172 police departments nationwide in possession of the unmanned aerial devices. College campus police have used drones in the past to monitor crowds at large events and assess traffic accidents - but the new Axon drone represents a potential new frontier for weaponized devices that advocates found concerning. More common than drones on campus is surveillance technology. The number of public schools deploying video surveillance systems has risen from 20% in 1999 to 83% in 2017, according to survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics. Thousands of American school districts, have contracted with tech companies to track students activities on school-issued computers, including to monitor what students search for and what websites they visit. Impero Software, a company that pitched its own technology directly in response to the Uvalde news, promises to monitor kindergarten through 12th grade students and flag warning signs such as searching for information on weapons Impero and similar companies use artificial intelligence to monitor all content students type in official school email accounts, chats or documents 24 hours a day, and this information is passed to the school to decide if anything should be acted on. A student who types how to kill myself into a search on a school computer could have police immediately called to their home, for example. Yet despite the growing adoption of security tools in schools across the US, the number mass shootings at schools has remained relatively constant throughout the past 30 years and reached an unprecedented high at secondary schools in the past five years. A study conducted by researchers at Washington University and Johns Hopkins found that surveillance responses to gun violence within kindergarten through 12th grade school systems have not stopped the increasing frequency of their occurrence, but have instead increased racial and ethnic disparities in multiple forms of discipline. Schools have steadily adopted security tools, such as surveillance cameras, despite mass shootings remaining constant. Photograph: Shafkat AnowarAP I am hearing more and more that schools are starting to look like prisons, and that makes young people feel more like suspects than students, said Odis Johnson, a professor at Johns Hopkins who co-authored the study. The presence of surveillance technology increases the capacity for schools to identify and discipline students for less serious offenses, Johnson explained, leading to more arrests of and legal action against children, particularly of students of color. Non-white students are also being surveilled in higher numbers: Johnsons research showed Black students are four times more likely to attend a high- versus low-surveillance school. Educators have fought for safe and welcoming schools for decades, so of course we want commonsense security and safety measures. But thats a far cry from efforts to turn schools into armed fortresses or make them operate like hi-tech prisons, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. That undermines the education of our kids who need safe places to play and just exist - thats why we want fewer, not more, guns on campuses. The Uvalde shooting, Weingarten said, was a tragic example of the limits of such tools. The district had already been using a student social media monitoring tool called Social Sentinel since 2019 and alerted parents just minutes after the shooting through an emergency response app called Raptor Technologies. Robb elementary was, whats known in the education sector, as a hardened school, where digital and physical security technology are deployed. While hardening will make security companies wealthy, it isnt a panacea for the problem of school shootings, she said. We only need to look at Robb elementary in Uvalde, a hardened school, where officers waited more than an hour to engage the shooter. Impero Software did not respond to a request for comment. For many school safety and gun control advocates, the debate around hi-tech security obscures the issue at the core of the school shooting scourge: access to guns is the primary risk factor for such tragedy. The only thing that keeps kids safe from mass shootings is making sure people do not have access to weapons of mass destruction that can kill entire classrooms of children in one clip, said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, a non-profit organization representing parents of children in schools. We cannot innovate our way out of this, she added. The saddest part about this is that it is not whether we know how to solve the problem, its whether we have the courage to do what is right by our children. * This article was amended on 1 and 15 July 2022. The school security industry was worth $2.7bn in 2017, not $2.7m as an earlier version said. In addition, the fact that information gathered by Impero and similar companies is passed to schools to decide if anything should be acted on has been clarified.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/jan\/23\/working-from-home-how-it-changed-us-forever","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/jan\/23\/working-from-home-how-it-changed-us-forever","DATE":"2022-01-23 08:00:18","PLAIN_TEXT":"Office life The future of work might find efficiency in compassion: it might not be focused on cities or require five-day weeks Eva Wiseman Ive read and thought more about office life over the last two years than I have at any time over the previous two decades when I worked in one. I say worked, but of course from this distance I can see that what I called office work might not quite stand up in a court of law, being comprised of equal amounts gossip, tea-runs and shouting passive aggressively at computers, alongside the clattery typing I am paid for. There was a moment, in those early pandemic days, the days of shock and clapping, before the felt-tip rainbows in our windows faded to a ghostly grey, when the closure of offices felt like an opportunity. The future of work might find efficiency in compassion - it might not be focused on cities or require five-day weeks, or offices with dubious rat control. For many of us, once we had cleared a decent space at the kitchen table and evacuated our children, working from home for the first time in our lives was a revelation. Yet every day brought another small hurdle, a step forward in our psychosocial development. Zoom meetings required a new kind of listening, along with the daily shock of our large, lined face at rest. The fashions wed cultivated were now obsolete. Bras and heels and other such fripperies seemed suddenly absolutely ridiculous, and Zoom style (bold accessories and jazzy jumpers) took hold. We learned how to translate the nuanced opacity of a colleagues Gchat in under three hours. Once wed clarified that our bosses were human, and not of the Pimlico Plumbers founders mould (The virus has turned millions into selfish, cowardly liars who dont give a damn about their fellow citizens so long as they can hide away at home while continuing to get paid, he said in 2020) we felt confident enough to fold our days into new shapes that allowed such luxuries as a mid-afternoon dentist appointment. And still, still we did our work. Better, some say. Faster, without the grim commute or distraction of eight other peoples failing relationships, or emails about toilets and printers and please refrain from leaving plates in the sink, or the exhausting knowledge that at any moment the person you fancy from the post room might appear and youll have to look up, glittering and fabulous. Though England has ended its work-from-home guidance, this time, surely, for good, we wont forget what we learned, the new ways of communicating, the particular realisations about our own mangled productivity, the importance of switching off when the work day ends. But nor will we forget what we missed about office culture, and what we appreciate afresh - the thrill of really good gossip, the unlikely community there, the change that happens when you leave the house. As many British office spaces remain vacant, it is projected that one in 10 will no longer be required by 2027, which suggests that while the grand work revolution is yet to emerge, a smaller shift, allowing a flake of flexibility, has taken place. One that has unearthed, among the coffee cups and charger cables, some dusty humanity. Housing If its tolerable to live further away from work, a house, a garden, might become affordable Rowan Moore One of the most enduring and intractable problems of British society is housing. There arent enough homes in the places where - for economic and sometimes social reasons - there is the greatest demand. This means London and some other big cities such as Bristol, Manchester and Edinburgh, Cambridge and Oxford, the south-east. Decades of attempts to build more homes in and around these hotspots repeatedly founder on local opposition (some of it reasonable, some of it not) to development. Too little gets built, and at too high a price. Working from home offers the attractive prospect of at least partly addressing this problem without laying a brick. If you only have to go into your office three days a week, its tolerable to live further away, in less overheated parts of the country, where the use of existing housing stock is slacker. A house, a garden - things which should not be unattainable dreams - might become affordable to those previously excluded from them. If you cant bring more affordable houses to where people are, in other words, perhaps people can choose places where affordable houses are. Other benefits would follow. People working from home might contribute more to their local economies and their famously suffering high streets by spending the money that they would otherwise be handing over to a big city Pret a Manger. They might have the time and mental space to be active members of local communities. It can only be a good thing if daily mass commutes become less intense. There would be environmental advantages to putting existing buildings to good use rather than building new homes. There are also drawbacks to this redistribution of human and financial energy. It can simply mean gentrification on a national scale. One of the less happy effects of the pandemic has been the pressure on notable beauty spots in places like Cornwall and Wales, as well-off buyers seek rural idylls for their remote working, further squeezing locals out of the housing market. There are plenty of jobs that can never be done remotely, often poorly paid, and relocation to less-expensive parts of the country is no kind of solution to the housing issues of those who do them. But there has never been any one solution to something as big, complex and multi-faceted as the housing crisis. What is the case is that there are many parts of the country where two- and three-storeyterraced houses can cost a tenth of what otherwise identical homes sell for in London. The disparity presents opportunities that shouldnt be lost in thestrange urge to rush back to five-day-a-week commuting. In Boris Johnsons Peppa Pig speech last November, an event so much outshone by subsequent scandals that it seems to belong to another era, he hinted that people who partly work from home might be called twats, on the basis that they come into their offices only on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Instead of throwing out cheap insults, he should salute them for their role in helping with one of the many problems his government is failing to solve. Food and drink People have discovered the joy of meal kits even if, or even because, they require a little finishing Jay Rayner In the summer of 2021, the north-west-based chef Gary Usher crowdfunded a new business. There was nothing new in that; hed done it numerous times for his restaurants. On this occasion, however, it was to fund a different kind of enterprise: one that would prepare and deliver the meal kit boxes that had got him through the pandemic. Theres no doubt that the lockdowns created an entirely new revenue stream for restaurant businesses like mine, Usher says. He did bigger trade in those kits over Christmas 2021, despite there being no lockdown, than he did in 2020, when there was a lockdown. It has, he says, continued into January. People have discovered the joy of importing restaurant-quality food into their homes even if, or perhaps even because, it requires a little finishing at home. Companies like Dishpatch, which works with well-known chefs including Michel Roux Jr, Angela Hartnett and Ravneet Gill to create ambitious meal kits, are thriving. Meanwhile, takeaways have become ever more sophisticated, and there have even been major advances in recyclable and compostable packaging. For the food sector, innovation in food delivery is the big dividend of the pandemic. For restaurants, the picture is much more mixed. The positives are that demand remains strong, says Kate Nicholls of industry body UKHospitality. When restrictions are lifted, diners do want to come out and have a good time. But it depends on location. The centre of London is in a dire state, with trading at only 20% to 30% of normal. In other city centres, its around 60%. Its in the suburbs, closer to where people actually live, that business is building healthily. But the restaurants themselves, robbed of Christmas business by Omicron and battered by staff shortages and food price inflation, may not be so healthy. A third of hospitality businesses have no cash reserves, Nicholls says. Whats more, they are trading into massive headwinds. Both the lower VAT rate for hospitality and the rent moratorium will finish at the end of March, Nicholls says. Plus, theres the increase to the national living wage, and the energy bill hike. It all amounts to a 13% cost price hike in the sector. Diners may be ready to eat out; a lot of the restaurants may no longer be there to feed them, without continued government support, she says. Which leaves many of us at home, interrogating our own kitchen skills. Theres no doubt theres been an awful lot of that, perhaps by necessity. The growth in retail food sales at the big supermarkets has been marked, up 5.4% year on year in 2020, then up again another 3.1% in 2021. In a retail market worth more than PS90bn, this is an enormous increase in spend on food to be consumed inside the home rather than outside. But what are people doing with it all? If cookbook sales - which saw double-digit percentage increases - are anything to go by, they are trying to improve their repertoire. As we finally emerge from restrictions it seems many of us have become rather better, and rather more ambitious, cooks. And all thanks to a virus. Relationships Will I have to learn new social codes? What will it be like being in the same room as my boss? Susie Orbach The difference between imagining going back to the office - sometime - and the announcement that we are to go back, is like night and day. A languorous exploration of what an individual was wanting, looking forward to or dreading, allowed for all possibilities: it will be good to see everyone, I will hate the journey, I hope the office venting is sound, I cant wait to have my lunch out and be part of an old but new physical ambience. The envisioning was abundant. Being able to challenge five days of relentless commuting and the juggling of domestic life had sparked creative solutions inconceivable two years ago. Some had babies in lockdown and cant imagine leaving them even for a few hours. Others were desperate to leave their childhood bedrooms or demanding partners who didnt take ones work as seriously as their own. The anticipation of being a little more separate was intoxicating for those who didnt want to see their schleppy partner, or themselves, in joggers endlessly, who didnt want anothers moods or needs constantly on show. The chance to sparkle, to get away from the domestic, from all those meals and dishes, was a magical fantasy. But there was also an ennui. Will we go back to the office only to find ourselves returning to the home again? Is the dangerous phase really over? Will we be gearing up only to deflate again? What kind of choices and personal agency will I have? How do I protect my vulnerable colleagues? Then the announcement came. You will return to work. No exemptions, unless your work decides it. An excitement and a chill. A fear as well. Will I lose the easy sharing and continuity I have with my partner, where we have to come to know what each other actually does daily as well as the triumphs and grinds of the jobs we do? Will it be akin to riding a bike or do I have to learn new social codes? What will it be like to be in the same room as my boss, students, co-workers? How will I respond to their smells, their looming, their presence and a work etiquette so different from bendy boundaries of work-from-home? Last spring I was approached by a few HR departments of large companies to prepare seminars for staff on returning to work. Interestingly, nothing came of the initiatives. It simply wasnt real enough to be happening, and the more pressing need was to help staff with the psychological changes - both helpful and difficult - that the stop-go of Covid was creating for the new geographies of work. It needed to address present dilemmas, not prospective ones. Work was and is where many live, thrive, have their struggles, have their identities affirmed or negated or some mix of the two. Now that the injunction to be at the office is seriously on the table, discussions are more focused on the practicalities of avoiding rush hour or finding childcare again and on the nervousness of leaving ones nest, how to get as much work done as one was doing when not commuting, managing ones bosss expectations and so on. The passion many Observer readers bring to work will be recast in the following weeks as the balance between togetherness and separation on the home front is recalibrated. Expect confusion, relief, pleasures and frustrations. In other words, life. We make it where we find it, rarely in conditions of our own making but which we mould as much as we can to satisfy ourselves. Shopping Lockdowns turned homewares into fast fashion used to dress home offices for work Zoom calls Zoe Wood The high street limped into the pandemic and the edict to work from home caused a retail earthquake. Shops were already closing and, two years of turmoil later, it has turbocharged the shift to online shopping and cost the high street billions of pounds of trade. In February 2020 online sales were around a fifth of retail spending, but by that Christmas they would be 37%. The easing of restrictions has seen that number fall back to 28%, but it is a dramatic shift in the balance of power that will affect the long-term financial viability of some high-street outlets. The hiatus forced people to replace shopping trips with clicks and buy everything from groceries to wardrobe updates (read tracksuit trousers and slippers) to toiletries and cars, online. This topsy-turviness, with so much time spent in our houses and flats, also had a dramatic impact on the profile of spending as people diverted cash spent on foreign holidays and socialising into room makeovers and garden projects. With social lives on hold, the going-out look was ditched in favour of cosy comfort. The trend was writ large in John Lewiss annual shopping report as demand for slippers, pyjamas and dressing gowns rocketed while the casualties included neck ties, briefcases, makeup bags and thongs. But if people were less invested in how they looked, the opposite was true of their homes. Lockdowns turned homewares into fast fashion used to dress home offices for work Zoom calls. This focus on home and hearth in 2021 saw an extra PS500m spent in DIY stores, while the countrys 1.2 million new gardeners spent an extra PS50m on plants, sheds and decking. This tilt to the web was the final nail in the coffin for big high street names already on the ropes, with Debenhams and Sir Philip Greens Arcadia shutting all their stores, following BHS. House of Fraser and John Lewis are still standing, but the department store model, with its fragrant beauty counters and huge expanses of fashion, has been shaken hard by restrictions that made it hard to try on clothes or smell perfume, or basically take any enjoyment from shopping. It will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle. With restaurants, cafes and pubs often off limits, the pandemic also signalled big changes for supermarkets. The big weekly shop came back with a bang while other consumers, including older shoppers, embraced home delivery for the first time. After going through the initial pain of setting up accounts, many are converts. With the number of empty stores at a record high, the pandemic has left scars on nearly every high street and shopping centre. But despite the gloom it is too early to deliver the postmortem because the sands are shifting again as last weeks reports of downturn at lockdown winners Peloton, the trendy exercise bike maker, and Netflix attest. In the UK Aldi is ditching Deliveroos delivery services because shoppers are returning to its stores. This is likely to be a trend as the cost-of-living crisis sees people seek out cheaper stores. We get the high street we deserve, so use it or lose it.

We are also a training practice with a steady flow of GP trainees and I am one of three trainers here. We have a large cohort of GPs and serve a varied population of young families, elderly housebound patients and university students. It is a buzzing and fast-paced environment. I feel very privileged that I can play a part in training the next generation of GPs. I remain very conscious of the need to be positive about the pivotal nature of our roles as family doctors and gatekeepers to the NHS, while at the same time being realistic. A working day can easily extend to 12 or 13 hours. I am a part-time GP but my hours are near full-time when training, supervision and partnership duties are factored in. It is the toughest and most time-pressured job I have ever done. There is no end point to the work and medical complexity continues to rise and can be hard to fit into 10- or 15-minute slots. Related: Two-thirds of trainee GPs in England plan to work part-time, study finds Thanks to the rise in allied professionals such as pharmacists and physiotherapists working in general practice, the cohort of patients that we GPs are seeing is changing to those with mental health problems and multi and complex morbidity. Telephone appointments do not always take less time and sometimes there is a back and forth of us trying to get hold of patients. This is often encroaching on time GPs have for family, exercise and social activities. On some days I can feel talked out, with little energy to engage in conversations with my husband or the children. My husband works in the NHS and understands the pressures. My older two kids, who are twins, join medical school this month and I worry what the future NHS will look like for this next generation. Often it feels like all roads lead to general practice, with often inappropriate passing of work to us. Get a note from your doctor is a common thing I hear most days at work. With the Covid backlog in hospitals and a national drive for reducing referrals, GPs are seeing more complex patients in primary care. There is also increased hospital correspondence such as emails that we write for advice and guidance from specialists. There are medical reports, repeat prescription requests and blood results to review - what I call unseen work. Much of this paperwork is done late into the evening or remotely on days off. At the same time, patients who really need to see a doctor worry about bothering their GP. Balancing the risk and uncertainty of who needs more input can be challenging and draining. In the current environment being a GP is becoming an almost impossible job to do well. GP training pathways are protected in terms of hours and sessions worked, which is a good thing for their learning, experience and progression. The number of face-to-face patients, contacts and admin workload is set in a way to develop and challenge but not overwhelm them. But they remain aware of how big a chunk of a GPs day consists of this unseen work. Just as many GPs have moved to part-time working or developing portfolio careers, so too are GP trainees, either during their training or as newly qualified GPs, as the Kings Fund research shows. This is a response to the state of general practice. The toll on doctors wellbeing in recent years has been huge. We have no control over the diktats that come from the government, which seem to show little understanding of general practice workload, the wellbeing of its staff or that NHS IT and buildings infrastructure are so inadequate. There is a big drive to expand GP training programmes to increase the workforce. But recruitment alone is not the answer. Unless the state of general practice is to change, where it becomes better resourced, boundaried and less politically driven, then the numbers of GPs out there will never equate to whole-time equivalents. If we want to attract the next generation of junior doctors into what can be one of the best jobs in the world then this change needs to happen now. We need more staff. But the government needs to support practices to increase building capacity to make room for staff, as this hasnt kept pace with expanding practices and list size. And ministers should also consider the impact of their changes such as evening and weekend working as existing staff cannot be stretched any more.

So you might be wondering if youre really Covid-negative or if the test is working as well as it should. There are many reasons why your RAT may not give you the results you expect. But one factor is whether RATs can detect the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid). We know the virus has mutated during the pandemic. So health authorities and researchers are investigating whether RATs can still detect the more recent versions of the virus. Related: Atagis strict Covid restrictions preventing desperate parents from vaccinating their children, expert says The good news is, based on the limited data released, all RATs meant for use at home in Australia that have been independently tested so far seem to be able to detect Omicron. The bad news is that not all RATs have been independently tested yet. Yours might be one of those. What do mutations have to do with RATs? RATs diagnose Covid infection by detecting specific viral proteins. So there are concerns that as the virus evolves and produces altered viral proteins, this may affect the tests ability to diagnose Covid as well as they detected previous variants. Whether RATs can adequately detect Omicron has been raised by authorities and researchers in various countries including The Netherlands, Belgium and Chile, as well as Australia. One Australian study tested six RATs on Delta, as well as Omicron lineages BA.4, BA.5 and BA.2.75. The researchers found the kits performed equally well across the different samples at higher viral loads (higher concentrations of the virus), although one kits overall sensitivity fell below minimum sensitivity requirements. However, some international studies have found RATs are less able to detect Omicron, particularly when viral loads are lower. So whats the case in Australia? Australias regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), initially relied on test data provided by RAT manufacturers to determine the test kit met World Health Organization standards for acceptable sensitivity (ability to detect a positive case). The TGA also requires manufacturers to send updated test data as new variants arise to demonstrate their test still meets those WHO standards. But the TGA has also commissioned independent testing of RATs to verify how well they detect the more recent Covid variants. They are tested for their ability to detect the wild-type virus (the original strain), the Delta variant and the Omicron variant. The TGA does not state which specific lineages (descendants) of Omicron are included in the testing. As it completes its analysis on individual tests (or groups of tests), the TGA reports them in a table thats publicly available, which will be updated as more data come in. Sign up for Guardian Australias free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup What does the table tell us? You can look up the brand name, manufacturer and batch number of the RAT you have at home. Look for those labelled self-tests (more on the different types of tests and their results later). The most important columns in the table are those that indicate whether the kit passed its independent validation. Look for four ticks to indicate the kit meets minimum standards for detecting the original virus, Delta and Omicron variants, and has passed the quality test. A cross indicates is has not passed that component of the validation. Related: Two-thirds of 15,400 extra Australian deaths in 2022 caused by Covid, study finds Havent found a result for your RAT? If a product comes in two versions - a self-test and a type of test used in healthcare facilities known as a point-of-care test (POCT in the table) - only one may be tested. If thats the case, the symbol + means testing was only done on one version and you can use those results for your test. Look for a matching registration number to make sure youre comparing like with like. The final column indicates what type of data the manufacturer has provided. Some manufacturers have tested the sensitivity of their kits for Omicron lineages BA.4 and BA.5. What does the table not tell us? Just because your test has no ticks or crosses against it, this doesnt mean it cant detect Omicron. It could be that the independent validation has yet to be completed or uploaded to the table. So the jury is out. The table also does not tell us what lineages of Omicron were tested for, although in some cases the manufacturer has supplied clinical test data. The table data were only current as of October. Seeing as the number of cases of subvariant infections has risen since then, so we dont really know if that is impacting on the sensitivity of even those tests that have recently been validated. Ive grappled with the table, now what? If your brand of RAT has the ticks, particularly for Omicron, it has been assessed as having an acceptable sensitivity. If you are buying a RAT, check the table to see if that brand has been tested for sensitivity to the Omicron variant. If your test has been sitting in a cupboard for months, check the expiry date before you use it. Also consider whether it has been stored at the correct temperature during that time (the instruction leaflet will tell you what that is).

He had been making films for 30 years. But shortly afterwards, he found himself feeling weary. I thought, things can only go downhill from here. Frith knew he needed to do something else - but what? A few years earlier he had bought his childhood home, which his mother had still been renting, and moved in with his wife, Emma, and two children for the final months of his mothers life. The house, in Gloucestershire, looks out over the Severn vale. As a boy, he loved to sketch birds. I was one of five sons to a single mum. We ran wild in the countryside and played like animals in the hedgerows. The return to his childhood home stirred some unacknowledged yearning in him, because while Frith wondered aloud about a second career in landscape gardening, he heard a different internal voice. That child who used to love drawing whispered to me down the years, he says. Frith bought pencils and began to sketch - mostly friends children. It was the first time he had drawn since childhood. At art school, which he attended before film school, he was a conceptual artist, and drawing was frowned upon as regressive. Frith had an idea. There was a great oak tree at Nibley Green, a couple of fields from home. It had stood out to his young self as a fantastical giant - a treasure trove, home to jackdaws, foxes, a barn owl, beetles, bats. It was a cave inside. We used to squeeze in through this hole. He decided he would lock himself away for two months to draw it in all its glorious detail. Frith drew every twig and every bud on a large sheet of paper, 150cm by 130cm. While I was drawing, he says, there came moments when it was as though the tree was drawing itself. I could feel the tree, I could smell the bark. I had spent so much time playing in that tree, it was deep inside me. And it emerged in this drawing. His finished oak held a real power, he says. As you walk towards it, it just grows. The detail emerges. A friend suggested he approach Felix Dennis, arts patron and lover of trees. I found out he was doing a poetry reading in Stratford-on-Avon, Frith says. I staggered into his dressing room with this great big drawing, plonked it down in front of him and said: Mr Dennis, I want to draw these oak trees. I knew the tree would talk. Right, he said, You better come and see me. Felix Dennis in 2006. Photograph: Karen RobinsonThe Observer At lunch a few weeks later, they talked for hours, drank three bottles of wine, and finally Dennis wrote a contract on a piece of paper that he rolled and stuffed inside one of the empty bottles. It was for 20 drawings of the most important oak trees in Britain. He would pay Frith regularly and handsomely. At 60, Frith had become a tree portraitist. Over the next three winters he travelled the length and breadth of Britain and spent days with each of the trees, selected with the help of the Ancient Tree Forum, the Tree Council, the Woodland Trust and other ancient tree nuts. In 2014 - the year Dennis died - Frith completed the project. The resultant collection was exhibited at Kew in 2018, Dennis having donated half the drawings before he died. Frith has since started work on a 20-drawing series of Britains most important ash trees. Against the backdrop of ash dieback, the project feels urgent. These beautiful old ash trees are going to be lost to us, he says. They are 350 years old and they are dying because of a disease that weve spread. Drawing is not only an act of care and a demand for preservation, but it gives me that interface between my passion for the natural world and my creativity, Frith says. It has also given him a different perspective on the passage of time. Im an old man yet Im only 71, and some of the trees Ive drawn are 1,000 years old. When Im with them and when I draw them, I think about my mortality and the brief nature of human life that passes fleetingly beneath them.

Ofsted is deciding whether to allow the home in Bolton to reopen after the local council, which cannot legally block the move, raised concerns with the inspectorate. Boltons director of childrens services said the case raised deep concerns about the residential care sector. Alison McGuinness is the mother of Robert McGuinness, a Lamborghini-driving onetime pub landlord who was exposed by the Guardian last year for spending thousands of pounds intended for educating marginalised children on drinking, foreign trips and his pub business. Together with Roberts father, Francis, the McGuinnesses ran Achieve Care Homes. They operated a home in Bolton which Ofsted closed in January last year after inspectors found that very inexperienced staff failed to meet childrens basic care needs. Staff had not entered one bedroom for more than four months despite evidence of flies and a pungent smell that spread throughout the home, Ofsted inspectors discovered. Robert McGuinness in a Lamborghini. Photograph: no credit Alison McGuinness has started a new company called Strive Services, which has applied to reopen the Bolton home under a different name. According to the Strive website, Moses Gate House is awaiting Ofsted registration and will be a therapeutic childrens residential home providing placements for up to two children aged 8-18yrs. Bolton council has written to Ofsted about Strives McGuinness connection, saying it will not be placing children there. Ofsted said it could not comment on individual cases, but that all applications for registration are subject to a rigorous assessment of suitability, including full checks of applicants background, experience and knowledge and a visit from inspectors. Kate OBrien, the director of care and operations at Strive Services, said: Strive is liaising transparently with Bolton council in relation to the process they normally follow when a company wishes to provide services of this type. Strive is working with Bolton council and Ofsted to achieve a positive outcome for all concerned. She declined to answer a series of questions, including whether Alison McGuinness had started a new company so that Ofsted would not realise that some of the same people were involved in trying to reopen the Bolton home. McGuinness did not provide any comments of her own. As well as running Achieve Care Homes, Robert McGuinness and his father also ran a community interest company (CIC) called Achieve Training Centre, which provided vocational training to children excluded from mainstream schools. A Guardian investigation found that Bolton and Bury local authorities paid PS1.5m to the CIC between 2015 and 2021. Profits from the CIC should have benefited the community, but instead Robert McGuinness, a plasterer turned publican, lent his bar business PS100,000 from the company. He also spent thousands from the CIC bank account on his social life and trips to Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Thailand. Although Robert McGuinness is not listed as a director of Strive, when the Guardian contacted the company for a comment, his lawyer replied. The lawyer said Robert McGuinness had paid back the money in full and that at its highest, Achieve helped cashflow of the pub business. Bernie Brown, the director of childrens services at Bolton council, said the case showed why the process for registering childrens homes needed to be more joined up. The current system involves Ofsted, social services and local planning authorities at various stages, but with limited coordination between the different agencies, she said: A national review is required to enable regulators, planners and carers to work more closely together in deciding who should be allowed to register homes, where they should be, and which children should be placed there. She said there were many excellent childrens homes, run by both private companies and local authorities. But she considers the current regulatory landscape problematic and wants the law changed to close a loophole in planning laws that allows providers to apply for change of use and open a home with limited experience. This is deeply concerning, especially while quality placements remain so scarce, she said. Though Bolton council says it will not place children with Strive, neighbouring Bury council said it was already working with the company and had so far paid the firm around PS17,000 for the care of one young person. While it awaits Ofsted registration for Moses Gate House, Strive is already operating Astley Brook House, supported accommodation for 16-18-year-olds in Bolton, which does not require Ofsted registration. After the Guardian exposed Robert McGuinness last year, Bury said it would stop sending children to Achieve. We were unaware of the link between the directors of this company and those of Achieve. Our commissioning team has not had any direct contact with Alison McGuinness, and we have had no concerns about the placement. We will now look further into this matter and make a decision on what is best for the young person concerned, a council spokesperson said.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/jun\/06\/from-refunds-to-missed-work-what-are-your-rights-if-your-flight-is-cancelled","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/jun\/06\/from-refunds-to-missed-work-what-are-your-rights-if-your-flight-is-cancelled","DATE":"2022-06-06 13:15:25","PLAIN_TEXT":"Thousands of Britons are stuck abroad after about 200 flights were cancelled over the weekend, including 80 by easyJet on Sunday. But what are your rights if you are one of those affected? What if I have to stay the night? If your return journey is cancelled you should contact the airline to find the next available flight. You have the right to choose between being refunded or rerouted on a new flight, either with the same airline or a different carrier. The airline is supposed to give you the chance to fly home on the same day, but if the departure is on a later date the carrier should help you find accommodation and cover the cost. It should also pay for expenses such as food, drinks and hotel transfers. Related: UK travel chaos: tips on what to do, from flight cancellations to passports Am I entitled to any other compensation? You can claim compensation if the flight was cancelled fewer than 14 days before departure. How much depends on the type of flight, on whether you take a refund or have the airline arrange a return trip, and on how much later your new departure and arrival are than your original plan. You can get up to PS220 for flights of less than 1,500km, up to PS350 for journeys between 1,500km and 3,500km and a maximum of PS520 for long-haul flights above 3,500km, according to Citizens Advice. Contact your airline for the full rules and to make a claim. Jan-Frederik Arnold, the chief executive of Flightright, said: You are entitled to compensation independently of the refund and hotel and dinner and so on. Airlines sometimes try to only accept one or the other because consumers dont know their rights. If you are forced to buy a new flight with a rival carrier, you can claim the cost of the replacement ticket. If your original flight was more expensive, however, you would be better off requesting a full refund. What if the airline doesnt offer to pay? If there is nobody to discuss compensation with - for example, if there is no one at the desk at the airport - you can make a claim later. Keep receipts for all the extra expenses you incur, including accommodation, food, drink and hotel transfers. According to the Civil Aviation Authority, airlines are unlikely to reimburse you for luxury hotels or alcohol, so keep your spending to a reasonable limit. What if my flight was part of a package holiday? In this case, your accommodation, food and transfer costs should be covered by the tour operator rather than the airline. Get in touch with the company as soon as possible. If you cant contact them you should keep a record of additional costs to claim a refund.

Shazia Shah, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, says: Those that have access to the work systems might be able to work from abroad but care is required to ensure no rules are breached, for example, in terms of tax or social security. Another option is to negotiate a compromise such as unpaid leave, or asking to make up the time later in order to not lose any pay.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2023\/jan\/10\/astonishing-pompeii-home-of-men-freed-from-slavery-reopens-to-public","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jan\/10\/astonishing-pompeii-home-of-men-freed-from-slavery-reopens-to-public","DATE":"2023-01-10 11:00:08","PLAIN_TEXT":"An ornate house - containing a fresco featuring a huge phallus - that was owned by two freed men freed from slavery in the ancient city of Pompeii has reopened to the public. The House of the Vettii was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79 before being rediscovered in a largely preserved state during excavations in the late 19th century. The home, believed to have been constructed in the second century BC, has reopened after years of complex restoration work. Erotic frescos feature in the house, which is believed to have incorporated a small brothel. Photograph: Silvia VaccaAtrio Vettii Located in the ancient citys wealthy quarter, the sprawling House of the Vettii was owned by Aulus Vettius Restitutus and Aulus Vettius Conviva, who became rich by selling wine after being freed from slavery. Theories in the past have suggested that the two men were brothers, but it is more likely that they met when enslaved and had the same master, whose name was Aulus Vettius, according to Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park. If they were from the same family the first two names would have been different and they would have the same surname, he said. It was uncommon to have biological siblings who were slaves and then set free, because family ties were cut with slavery so its very unlikely they were brothers. Its more likely that they were buddies during their time as slaves and then set free. Priapus, the god of fertility and abundance, with a scale and bag of money - symbolising the wealth accumulated by the houses owners. Photograph: Silvia VaccaAtrio Vettii Restitutus, meaning given back, was a typical name given to a freed slave, Zuchtriegel said. It was not unusual for people freed from slavery to thrive in ancient Pompeii, and the House of the Vettii was filled with elegant frescoes by the two wine traders, who also expanded the home to include a garden with statues and a fountain. Among the most striking frescoes is one at the entrance of the home: this depicts Priapus, the god of fertility and abundance, with a large penis balancing on a scale next to a bag filled with money, thought to have symbolised the wealth accumulated by the men. Inside the home is a 15cm-high frieze that runs along the wall of a room believed to have been a dining room, which features cupids engaged in activities such as making perfume or selling wine. It also depicts divine couples and gods including Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. A small room close to the kitchen, which contains erotic frescoes, was believed to have been used as a brothel. Next to Priapus at the entrance is a small inscription in Latin which refers to a woman with a Greek name, who is described as having nice manners, alongside an image of two Roman coins. The inscription is believed to have referred to the homes small brothel. Aulus Vettius Restitutus also joined the high-ranking Augustales, a college of priests who were in charge of a form of emperor worship. A frieze showing cupids at work runs around the wall of one room. Photograph: Luigi SpinaCasa dei Vettii 26 Zuchtriegel said the abundance of treasures contained in the House of the Vettii is absolutely astonishing and if he was a visitor to Pompeii and had the opportunity to see just one home in the archaeological park, it would be this one. This is the house which tells the story of Roman society, he said. On the one hand you have the artwork, paintings and statues, and on the other you have the social story [of the freed slaves]. The house is one of the relatively few in Pompeii for which we have the names of the owners. * This article was amended on 10 January 2023.

The condition, usually associated with autism, makes it difficult to remember peoples faces. This means that, in high-stress situations, I am often unable to match someones face to their name or even remember if Ive met them before. When I worked at an office, I inadvertently offended colleagues who did not understand why I struggled to place who they were. This is just one way that the daily office environment made my career difficult to navigate. Working from home, as I have for the past three years, has made a positive difference in my ability to be a successful, confident journalist, and a happier person overall. Related: I wanted more memories: young people reflect on a year lost to Covid For years, people with invisible disabilities - including neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - have campaigned for accommodations that would allow us to do our jobs well. Chief among these is the flexibility to work from home. For many of us, the remote work era facilitated by Covid-19 has changed our lives for the better, despite the grief and anxiety of the pandemic. Now, as the world begins to reopen and offices throw open their doors, many are afraid the era of working from home - where they feel more comfortable, productive and safe - is coming to an end. A culture of workplace inflexibility In our research, what we found was that working from home was amongst the most required accommodations or support that people with all types of disabilities reported needing, says Arif Jetha, part of a team of researchers who study workplace accessibility issues at the University of Torontos Institute for Work and Health. This essential accommodation request was also one of the most unmet needs by employers, Jetha says. Employers would often say that this is not in our policy. We just dont do that. Paula*, a social worker in Liverpool, England (who requested that the Guardian change her name to protect her privacy), is autistic. In an office, she struggles with processing information and concentrating. Though she is easily able to complete her jobs administrative tasks without going into an office, before the pandemic, her direct manager required her to put in a new request every time she wanted to work from home. Eventually, she says, she gave up. When the whole company transitioned to remote work during the pandemic, it threw into sharp relief the absurdity of having to make frequent requests to work from home - requests that were often denied. It is frustrating to hear [co-workers] complain about their needs not being met because theyre now working from home, Paula says. I really have to bite my tongue to stop from asking them, Yeah, hows that feel? Becca*, a journalist in London who requested that only her first name be used because she hasnt gone public with her autism and ADHD diagnoses, says she has absolutely faced hurdles climbing the career ladder because of her disabilities. I personally really struggle with processing different sounds at the same time. I always found it really difficult to work in an office with music playing and then listening to someone talk, Becca says. Brainstorming in a team of extroverts was also awful. I dont like shouting over people and process written language so much better [than spoken conversation]. As a result, Becca says that employers and co-workers would assume she didnt have any of her own ideas. This, and her discomfort with social situations and networking activities, made it difficult for her to get recognition for her work and the value she brought to her teams. Becca has worked from home for years now, which she prefers to working in the office. So much flexibility, lots of movement, many, many showers per day! A fan on me at all times, she says. Office spaces feel geared towards mentally well people and neurotypical people. At home, she can orient her work situation, more or less, how she wants it. Opportunity for reassessment A 2020 analysis of job market data shows that, although people with physical or mental impairments can benefit greatly from workplaces with flexible remote work policies, were more likely to be denied such jobs, and instead find employment in precarious, inflexible service work and other blue-collar jobs. But even in white-collar office positions, the disability disclosures that many employers require for even the most basic accommodations can present roadblocks. Providing documentation [of diagnoses] can be extremely difficult, traumatic and personal for people, says Jalyn Radziminski, the communication manager for the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Everyone does not have the same access to healthcare, funds and insurance to afford to be able to see someone consistently to provide paperwork. Thats not all. People who disclose mental illness or other invisible disabilities such as autism often experience stigma after disclosure, says Simon Bury, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Olga Tennison Autism Research Center at LaTrobe University in Melbourne, Australia. This has led to reports of being overlooked for promotions, being discriminated against in task allocation that could lead to promotion, or simply being fired. With the requirement of disclosure, many of us are stuck between a rock and a hard place: disclose, and face significant stigma for our diagnosis. Refrain from disclosure, and struggle to explain why we have trouble with situations that other workers navigate with ease. But theres a way forward. Jetha, the Institute of Work and Health researcher, says that by implementing universal accessibility principles, like remote work options for all employees, employers help eliminate the need for individuals to disclose private diagnoses. Remote work options benefit everyone. Parents can easily stay home with sick kids. Someone whos feeling down for personal reasons can take the space they need without missing work. A commuter who lives far from the office can stay home when traffic is bad, or simply when they dont have the energy for a long commute. Even as pandemic restrictions recede, theres reason to hope that employers will allow their workers the flexibility they want or require. Many workers who might have previously been denied remote work alternatives, part- or full-time in the past, may now have a renewed opportunity to negotiate flex-place and flex-time working alternatives that make them far more productive, and lower stress and anxiety, says Susanne Marie Bruyere, the director of the Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability at Cornell University. This is hopefully one positive outcome from the pandemic - that organizations realize that there are many ways to work, and among them is working from home [or] remotely. Most critically, a flexible workplace allows people to take care of their needs as they arise, without judgment. The pandemic made clear that for people who work in an office setting, most of our jobs can be done just fine from home. Companies that want to support all employees, not just those who fit a narrow mold, may realize that remote work policies have the capacity to make a happier, more productive workforce.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/25\/stay-at-home-dads-attitude-shift-pandemic","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/25\/stay-at-home-dads-attitude-shift-pandemic","DATE":"2022-12-25 17:00:07","PLAIN_TEXT":"There he stumbles across our screen, failing to plait his little girls hair, or work out how the washing machine works, or soothe his baby. The underlying message of the pervasive, hapless dad stereotype is as subtle as a sledgehammer: dads are second-grade caregivers, their value lying elsewhere. However, analysis suggests that for an increasing number of men, this stereotype is not only outdated, but wide of the mark. The number of stay-at-home fathers - who can, one imagines, have a decent stab at a French braid and know which compartment the fabric softener goes in - has risen by one-third since 2019. One in nine stay-at-home parents are fathers, up from one in 14 in 2019, according to analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics. These figures are, of course, only a snapshot and the reality is that women still vastly outnumber men in the ranks of stay-at-home parents. But the number of stay-at-home mums is, for now, dropping, by 11% in the past three years. So, whats going on? In the maelstrom of the pandemic, some suggested there could be a sliver of a silver lining in the pitch-black cloud: nothing less than a fundamental shift in parenting roles, which includes, perhaps, fathers seeing full-time caregiving as a possibility. Research suggested that while women bore the brunt of childcare during lockdown, were less likely to be able to work uninterrupted and were being hit harder economically, the amount of time men were spending with their children surged. For many men, it may have transformed not only how they worked, but how they saw their role within the family. And at least some of that metamorphosis seems to have endured. Research from the Fatherhood Institute charity shows men are spending 18% longer on unpaid childcare than they did in 2015 and 14% longer on domestic work. The shift in homeworking has also been remarkable: working fathers spend 37% of their work time at home (up from 6% in 2014-15), compared with 27% of working mothers time (up from 6%). It is possible that an enforced period at home and many more hours with their children honed the skills of many fathers, and perhaps gave some the confidence to take time out of work to become primary carers. Some of this may be economic: the long view shows the numbers of men (data specifically on fathers began only in 2018) who are inactive due to family and home reasons ticking up after economic crises, rising in the 1990s and the 2010s. We already know that more than 600,000 missing workers have been lost from the UK economy since the pandemic. Experts have speculated that the pandemic triggered a Great Resignation because of burnout and a re-evaluation of priorities. It seems likely that many working parents found they liked spending less time commuting and more time with their children. As one father put it: If Id been in the office, I dont think it would have crossed my mind to become a stay-at-home dad. Perhaps it is a data blip, but a growing body of research suggests parenting styles are changing - mothers are working more, fathers are caring more. Why does it matter? As recent research into gender role attitudes suggests, these new fathers could prompt exponential growth in gender egalitarianism over generations. Fingers crossed.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2023\/mar\/08\/uk-anti-slavery-post-left-unfilled-by-home-office-since-april-2022","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/mar\/08\/uk-anti-slavery-post-left-unfilled-by-home-office-since-april-2022","DATE":"2023-03-08 16:59:08","PLAIN_TEXT":"The role of the independent watchdog overseeing government anti-slavery policy has been left vacant for more than 10 months at the same time as cases of suspected trafficking have hit an all-time high, it has emerged. Dame Sara Thornton, the previous anti-slavery commissioner, resigned on 30 April last year, but has not been replaced by the home secretary, Suella Braverman, despite a legal requirement for the post to be filled. Meanwhile, new Home Office statistics have revealed that 21,518 potential victims of trafficking, slavery and forced labour were reported in 2022 - an all-time high. Of those, 16,938 gave their consent to be referred by authorities via the national referral mechanism (NRM), up 33% from the previous year and the highest number on record since the NRM began in 2009. The records further show that 4,580 reports on potential victims, who did not provide consent for a referral or were too young to do so, were reported via the duty to notify (DtN) process - also the highest number since that scheme opened in 2015. Thornton, now a professor of modern slavery policy at the University of Nottingham, left the commissioner role at the end of her three-year tenure. The vacant position was advertised in December 2021 and the final interviews took place on 14 April last year, but no announcement of an appointment was forthcoming. Under the Modern Slavery Act, the commissioner has a UK-wide remit to encourage good practice in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of modern slavery offences and the identification of victims. In January, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, tabled a bill that could enable MPs to appoint a new commissioner, in an attempt to force the home secretarys hand. It did not, however, win the backing of the government. Carmichael, a former cabinet minister, said the government was seeking to avoid scrutiny of its failures. He said: Ministers should hang their heads in shame. They are failing vulnerable people and letting modern slavery run riot across the country. Britain has a proud tradition of protecting refugees and yet the governments plans are flawed and callous. These record increases highlight the Conservatives absolute failure to get a grip on the real issues and instead prefer to throw around dangerous rhetoric. Whats worse is that they have refused to appoint a new anti-slavery commissioner for nearly a year now. This heartless government is watching on while this crisis spirals out of control. We need urgent action now, starting with finally appointing a new commissioner. After stepping down from her role, Thornton made public her previously private warnings to the then home secretary, Priti Patel, about the nationality and borders bill that was designed to rid the system of pull factors by threatening to send people to Rwanda. Since then, the government has admitted that the immigration system is broken and ministers have faced a legal battle to make their Rwanda initiative work. No one has been deported to Rwanda since the bill was made law. Braverman has since proposed a bill under which the government would have the right to criminalise, detain and deport asylum seekers who arrive in the country illegally, particularly through small boats crossing the Channel. The commissioner role was advertised for a second time on 23 February but the Home Office has not put a deadline on selecting a candidate. A Home Office spokesperson said: Modern slavery is a barbaric crime and we remain committed to stamping it out. We provide support to thousands of victims each year, as well as working with a wide range of partners to prevent this terrible crime from happening in the first place. However, it is clear people are abusing our system when they have no right to be here.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/jun\/28\/remote-working-v-the-office-four-company-bosses-have-their-say","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/jun\/28\/remote-working-v-the-office-four-company-bosses-have-their-say","DATE":"2021-06-28 05:00:45","PLAIN_TEXT":"The global pandemic and lockdown restrictions forced many UK businesses to move employees to remote working, practically overnight.

Its not always practical from a team building perspective, and some things are taking longer than they used to. A staff survey we did a few weeks ago surprised me a bit. Some people said theyre less productive working from home, and some would like the option of coming back in. The 38-year-old plans to use the office then, after a break clause, to use a smaller space for meetings at the start of new projects. But going remote has brought one huge plus, Newns says. Weve always struggled a bit with Birmingham from a recruiting perspective. We can now recruit from parts of the country it would have been impossible to commute from. We just hired someone from Leeds, and were looking further afield, which is amazing.

We gave up our Bristol office in December 2019, and planned to open up a new one in Swansea. But just as we had shortlisted some spaces, the pandemic landed and I was working at the dining room table. While Ive missed not seeing my team in person, Zoom has made meetings very efficient. Nevertheless, the move to remote working created some complications. Sherrington had a 50% drop in income and prices had to be reduced, because so much online was free. But operating completely online has clearly worked as we have opened a new hub in Hertfordshire, and one in New York. There seems no merit in forcing anyone to come into a central location. So long as we get a team Christmas party, Im happy to keep this up. An office-based business feels very dated now.

Photograph: Nick EllisonHandout Nick Ellison, 33, from Malvern, is the managing director of a digital technology consultancy, Purr. When the first lockdown looked likely, we were in a fortunate position with our central London office as the lease had never been formally signed. I took a van and a helper, emptied the whole place and gave the keys back. Weve had a flexible approach to the office for a couple of years - but I think it surprised the staff how little they missed it and during the pandemic a number went on to move out of London. We decided fairly early on that wed permanently not go back to an office, but opt for local coworking space for staff and book occasional meeting rooms in London instead. Since going fully remote, the company has grown significantly. We went from eight people to 16, and invested the savings in wages and a laptop upgrade for everyone. But we want people to be based within a couple of hours of London so we can get together when we want to. When we do, we pay all expenses and travel time. But there are also downsides, Ellison concedes. In our industry its crucial to have that London connection, its important to our clients. Weve been testing various London spaces for meetings, on a pay-as-you-go basis rather than a monthly membership. Theres also the issue of maintaining oversight of staff who are working from home. People tend to get more work done remotely, but also feel more burnt out. Theres a tendency for staff to work through their lunch, as they want to demonstrate that theyre working hard, and they feel exhausted by the end of the day. Nobody should feel left to their own devices, you have to keep checking in.

Despite the business hanging by a thread we borrowed more money and did the opposite [to the home working trend]: we took a corner shop in the high street in East Sheen and turned it into a studio. We have found that opening an office has improved the way we work. We have an apprentice, and a lad doing work experience. How are they possibly supposed to learn remotely? By revitalising a disused shop, we have also taken care of our marketing needs as thousands of cars pass us daily. We have been living month by month, but weve recently seen an increase in sales.

John describes the pitiful number of council houses being built in England, and hence the worsening housing crisis, with millions unable to afford their own home. Peggy describes a proposal by Oxford city council to build 32 houses in Iffley village, Oxford, as ecocide and a crime. I know this housing proposal is unpopular with many locally: it is one reason I lost my Labour Oxford city seat in 2021, in the adjoining council ward to Iffley. The very same opponents would often say the housing crisis is Oxfords biggest problem. I appreciate the need for biodiversity, but the council proposes to translocate protected species in the proposed development. This is not ecocide. Surely people, particularly those who own their own homes outright, need to weigh in the balance the needs of those requiring housing? Satisfying Peggys argument that this development is an example of a growth agenda to which we have become addicted would mean stopping almost all housebuilding, and making it even more difficult to address the housing crisis.Richard TarverOxford * I found John Harriss article on the housing crisis to be a really strong analysis. As he said, the old Tory vision of the property-owning democracy may be shrinking. But, with Labour promoting itself as the party of home ownership, we are a long way from tackling the heart of the crisis. People need safe, secure, decent and affordable places to live. Home ownership is clearly one way to achieve this. But ever since the Tory vision led to the expectation that prices will always rise, houses have become investments rather than places to live. This is the crux of the current crisis. Until it changes, and a fall in prices may help, the equally viable and workable option of lifelong secure tenancies, which John described, is unlikely to get the political momentum it needs.Steve TownsleyBridgend * Have an opinion on anything youve read in the Guardian today?

Yet it remains a woolly issue that is under-researched and poorly understood, allowing bad advice and expensive mistakes to stalk the landscape. But sorting mould can be relatively simple, if you know how. Heres our expert guide. Why do I have mould? Dont be so surprised. Mould is everywhere, all the time, says Dr Yasemin Aktas, deputy academic director of the UK Centre for Moisture in Buildings (UKCMB), a nonprofit organisation formed by University College London, to improve the way moisture risk is understood and managed in the UK. We live in a wet country, so we have to expect that we are going to get some mould growth, perhaps in the bathroom, on windows and other cooler areas. But its important that we do our best to clean it regularly to stop it building up. Its very difficult to manage mould in UK buildings and its very common. UKCMB has a handy moisture calculator to help assess the moisture balance in your home, along with guidance for people moving into new homes, and explainer videos for people living in older buildings. Mould patches on walls or ceilings should never be ignored. Photograph: EkspansioGetty Images What is a problematic amount? Patches on walls or ceilings should never be ignored - even if theyre not currently posing a health threat, theyre increasing the spores in your air, encouraging more mould to take hold on any hospitable surfaces. You can also rely on your nose to alert you to problems. Sometimes the mould isnt visible, says Aktas, because it is inside the fabric of the building, such as in cavities, or behind heavy furniture. If you can smell it, there is definitely a damp problem, even if it has not manifested on the interior surfaces. Can the airborne spores in my home be measured? The short answer is yes, says Aktas, but its complicated. If you do mould testing anywhere, you will find some mould, but at what level it becomes a problem is something that is not well established yet and therefore hasnt transpired into policies or practices. This point is echoed in a new article in the journal Nature by a number of scientists including the UKs chief medical officer Chris Whitty. Aktas and her team at UCL are working to benchmark these levels, so that we can give some guidance to the water remediation industry as to when they should be alerted and should be intervening. Currently, she says, the many different methods to test mould are often not comparable, and there is no clear protocol on how to interpret them. There are so many businesses that flourish on this knowledge gap. They go to peoples homes testing and scaremongering, saying the mould is too high, you need PS6,000 worth of work. With no proper guidance, you cant judge if this person is telling you the truth. What are the health risks from mould? Based on international research data, says Jouni Lohi, a pathologist at the University of Helsinki, it is known that living or working in a building with moisture damage can cause asthma, asthma exacerbation, allergic alveolitis and increased susceptibility to respiratory infection. Other symptoms that have been reported include, eye, ear, and skin irritation. There are also indications of a link between moisture damage or microbial exposure to neurological symptoms and fatigue. He says that those with pre-existing respiratory conditions may be at a higher risk, but possible risk is present across all age groups. He recommends that if you have any symptoms related to these conditions, it is worth identifying and dealing with mould growing in your home or workplace. How do I stop the mould? Cleaning mould and repainting wont make it go away for ever. You need to find and address what is causing it to flourish in certain areas. It could be one or a collection of factors that are tipping the moisture balance unfavourably. One of the things that trigger it in our homes is excess moisture condensing on cold surfaces, making them susceptible to mould growth, says Aktas. Some sleuthing will be necessary to figure out why theres too much water vapour floating about. Is there too little ventilation? Do you open windows or use extractor fans when cooking, showering or drying clothes? Or there may be water seeping somewhere in your home, leaking from a pipe under the floorboards, through a damaged roof or chimney stack. Pointing is very important, says Aktas, because most of us live in masonry homes and one of the main pathways of moisture into the building fabric is if the mortar joints are damaged or eroded. Faulty guttering is another potential culprit, causing external walls to become saturated. There is also a slim chance that damp might be rising from the ground up the walls, which usually creates a tell-tale water mark around the damp patch. This can mean a new damp proof course is needed, which is expensive and disruptive, so try measures to rule out condensation - a more common cause - first. Will increasing insulation help? While boosting insulation will reduce the amount of cold surfaces for water vapour to condense on, and help keep your home warmer, it can also decrease airflow and trap water in the home. David Prince, a damp specialist at Abbott Property Care, recently encountered a bungalow that didnt have a damp problem until a government grant enabled the owners to install extra loft insulation. Soon after its installation, water started dripping from the ceiling. The new layer, he says, stopped the breathability of the building and condensation was occurring between the new insulation laid on top of old insulation. The motto when retrofitting energy-saving measures, says Aktas, is no insulation without ventilation. Air tightness is important when trying to improve the energy efficiency of our homes - we dont want the air exchange between indoors and outdoors to be very high because then you have to heat fresh air constantly. How can I ventilate without letting the cold in? Retrofitting trickle vents above windows will supply you with a small, steady stream of fresh air, but while they will help reduce condensation, they will let in tiny cold draughts in winter (although a lot less than opening a window). Extractor fans are more effective for particularly wet rooms such as bathrooms and kitchens, but these can also let in draughts. The good news is that, depending on the model, you may be able to retrofit yours with a backdraught shutter that closes when the fan is not in use. Meanwhile, progress in energy-saving technology means you can now get heat recovery ventilation where the air that is taken inside to replace the moist air is heated by the moist air going out, says Aktas. These are relatively quiet, inexpensive and in their simplest version, as easy to install as an extractor fan. Journalist Sue Wheat, who blogs for Ecologist about converting her Victorian house into an ecohome, had some Kair versions fitted, which have sensors that switch them on when humidity reaches levels that enable dust mites and mould to flourish. They are energy efficient, recover 86% of the heat from the outgoing air and mean that her windows, which used to be streaming wet on cold mornings, now stay dry. The single units currently retail at PS286. While dehumidifiers dont address the core problem, they can help mitigate the moisture imbalance. Photograph: MaryvioletGetty ImagesiStockphoto Do dehumidifiers help? The experts I have spoken with do not tend to recommend these - largely because they dont address the core problem. But if youre stuck in an overpopulated building or your landlord wont install ventilation or seek out the source of the damp, these machines can help mitigate the moisture imbalance. They come in many shapes and sizes and collect water from the air in a tank that needs manually emptying when full. Realistically, you cant have one in every room, making noise, taking up space, using electricity all the time, but if you need to switch one on for a couple of hours when your laundry is hanging out to dry, says Prince, as opposed to putting all that moisture in your air, I think thats worth looking at. Will turning the heating down help with condensation? Cold houses will be more likely to have condensation, says Aktas. When the air is warmer, its capacity to hold moisture increases, but when its cooler the moisture has to find other places to hold on to. Plus the cold walls will become even colder, inviting more water to condense on them. When cleaning affected walls, open windows and avoid inhaling mould-removal products. Photograph: imageBROKERAlamy How do you clean mould? Make sure you dont disturb the mould with a brush or dry cloth as youll disperse the spores. You cant just paint over it without killing it first, says Richard Thomas, group sales and operations manager at Rabart Decorators Merchants, who has rectified mouldy walls in damp churches, listed buildings and prefab social housing. Some people use bleach diluted in water, he says, which is fine, but messy, and not quite as effective on walls. Youre better off, he says, using a mould spray that contains a biocide such as DDAC - about 1 or 2%. As with bleach, you dont want to inhale it, get it on your skin, expose pets to it or pour it into a river. But as long as you keep the window open while using it, take precautions commensurate to how big an area youre working on, and avoid long-term exposure, Thomas doesnt see it as a huge risk. In lesser amounts, he says, biocides like this go into hand gels, soaps and antibacterial products. Wipe off the excess, allow it to dry and then its as simple as using two coats of paint and will prevent mould growth recurring. Using anti-mould paint doesnt prevent the problem of moisture but it prevents the manifestation of mould. Photograph: gece33Getty ImagesiStockphoto What are the best anti-mould paints? First, beware anti-damp paints, which are designed to stop water coming through the wall and will likely trap moisture in the wall. Older brick or stone houses need to breathe, says Thomas. You want to maintain the permeability so you always want a product that describes itself as breathable or vapour permeable. This includes avoiding those ultra durable and wipeable paints containing vinyl. When it comes to anti-mould paints, he says, there are lots on the market of varying degrees of success. All paint contains a biocide which stops it going off in the can. Products that describe themselves as anti-mould would have a higher percentage. It doesnt prevent the problem of the moisture, it prevents the manifestation of the mould, if you get the right paint. I have been in some very poor quality accommodation thats been redecorated appropriately, and all the moisture is still there because no ventilation or insulation has been added. But what you wont get is the mould. Older brick and stone buildings tend to have more moisture in the walls than modern cavity wall buildings anyway. Thomas says that almost all the leading trade paint manufacturers have anti-mould or mould inhibiting paints, including ranges by Zinsser, Crown Trade Paint and Dulux . If youre new to this, he recommends asking an independent paint merchant for advice. There are lots of companies out there that make it sound incredibly complicated, because it is their business to come in and rectify these issues. But really, its about treating the area thats affected by redecorating it in a more suitable way. And then in the long-term maintaining adequate and sensible ventilation. When wardrobes are full, air struggles to circulate, and, when fitted against a cold wall, the damp can damage clothes and shoes. Photograph: Nicola TreeGetty Images How can I stop mould in my wardrobe? When wardrobes are full, air struggles to circulate, and when fitted against a cold wall, damp can cause your clothes and shoes to go off like an old bit of cheese at the back of the fridge. Prince says that there are insulating products, that you can stick on the back wall yourself; usually foam based, just to take the cold edge off. There are also disposable dehumidifying sachets that, he says, collect water and then you disregard them. He also recommends cordless mini-dehumidifiers that use silica crystals to absorb the water. After about three to four weeks, when the panel on the front changes colour, says Prince, you take it out and put it on the charger overnight and it dries it out again. What rights do renters have if mould appears in their homes? It depends on the cause of the mould, says John Gallagher, principal solicitor at the charity Shelter. Where the mould is caused by disrepair or the property is unfit for habitation - for example, as a result of damp or condensation caused by poor insulation or faulty heating or ventilation systems - then it is the landlords responsibility to fix it, and it is important that tenants let their landlord know about the problems as soon as possible. However, as its not always immediately obvious what the cause of damp is, expert advice may be needed. Sometimes the mould may be put down to the tenant not ventilating the home correctly and in those cases the landlord may not be responsible. When should a landlord step inpay for repairs to fix a mould problem? Once a landlord is made aware of the issue they should carry out repairs within a reasonable period of time, says Gallagher. What is reasonable will depend on the specific circumstances, but where there is a serious risk to the health of the occupiers, the works should be done urgently. Landlords for social housing have the same responsibilities as private ones, but, social landlords may have internal policies relating to timescales which they should adhere to. If the mould is really bad and the property is unfit for habitation, says Gallagher, a person may be classed as homeless and in this case they could make a homeless application to the council. If they fall into the priority need category, because of having children or health complications, they could be entitled to emergency accommodation. Anyone worried about mould causing dangerous conditions in their home can come to Shelter for help and advice. * The main image on this article was amended on 1 March 2023.

In a memo to all employees, Tim Cook, Apples chief executive, said the policy would require all staff to return to the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as well as a third day that would vary team by team. We are excited to move forward with the pilot and believe that this revised framework will enhance our ability to work flexibly, while preserving the in-person collaboration that is so essential to our culture, Cook said in the memo. The official plan, emphasised as just a pilot in Cooks letter, is already a step back from an earlier proposal for all employees to come in on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday every week. The shift to a flexible day in addition to the two midweek days will allow some employees to continue to have four unbroken days at home each week. Apple had long been an outlier among its peers on the question of remote working. While tech companies including Twitter and Facebook implemented policies at the start of the Covid pandemic that allowed employees to opt for permanent home working, Apple has maintained throughout that its long-term plan is for all employees to return to in-person work. In June 2021, when Apple first proposed a return to the office for three days a week, Cook told employees that for all that weve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other. Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate. The companys hardline stance on remote work has cost it already. In May, Ian Goodfellow, Apples director of machine learning, quit barely two years after being poached from Google to rejuvenate its virtual assistant Siri and the companys other AI projects. Goodfellow explicitly cited the return-to-work policy as the reason for his departure, telling staff: I believe strongly that more flexibility would have been the best policy for my team, according to the Verges Zoe Schiffer. Goodfellow rejoined Google, working for the companys Deepmind subsidiary. Apples stance is still not quite as strict as that taken by the car manufacturer Tesla. In a memo sent in early June, Elon Musk told employees to return to the office for a minimum (and I mean minimum) of 40 hours per week or quit the company. Employees were entitled to work remotely in addition to that time in the office, he said, but if they thought remote work was sufficient, they should pretend to work somewhere else.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/oct\/01\/back-to-office-say-bosses-staff-prefer-working-from-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/oct\/01\/back-to-office-say-bosses-staff-prefer-working-from-home","DATE":"2022-10-01 15:00:12","PLAIN_TEXT":"You havent been in the office this week. Why? The worker in question hadnt expected such an email from his boss. Based in Asia but working for a large US media organisation, he had been on an overseas work trip, and his failure to swipe his pass at the buildings turnstiles while he was away had triggered an alert. This is an extreme example of business leaders straining to reverse pandemic home working habits, but it reflects an increasingly tense battle within public and private organisations. Months after Covid restrictions in the UK were lifted, there has not been a large-scale return of office workers to their desks. Now a tug-of-war is playing out between those who wish to see flexibility about where, and sometimes when, people do their jobs become a permanent fixture, and those keen to return to pre-pandemic patterns. On one side are the many staff who say performing their role remotely and spending less time - and money - commuting has improved their work-life balance, given them more time with family and increased productivity. On the other side are frustrated managers at large office-occupiers who say they want to reignite their workplaces with the collaboration and creativity that comes from in-person interaction. Many bosses had hoped the end of the summer holidays would bring more staff back to their desks. And according to property consultancy Remit, in the first full working week of September, the daily average number of employees in England and Wales working from the office hit its highest level since May 2021. But that high was just 31%. In the capital, office occupancy reached 50% on single days in the week to 9 September in the West End and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Docklands, home to many banks and financial institutions which have been loud proponents of back to office. You tell your employees the unique value of the office is other people, but then go into the office and no one is there Alexia Cambon, Remit This is a sign of a slow but sustained return to the workplace, according to Lorna Landells at Remit, although the data also shows employees much more likely to go in on core midweek days than on Monday or Friday. The number of passengers travelling on Londons underground system has slowly risen, but remains stuck about a quarter below pre-pandemic levels. How organisations manage hybrid working - where colleagues split time between the office and home or another remote location - was top of the agenda at a recent human resources conference in Docklands hosted by consultancy Gartner and attended by HR teams from some of the UKs largest firms. Businesses are trapped in a vicious cycle, says Gartner research director Alexia Cambon. The majority of organisations I speak to are trying to market the office as a place for collaboration, community and connection. When you tell your employees that the unique value proposition of the office is other people, but go into the office and no one is there, youre setting them up for disappointment. Cambon added: Its an interesting conundrum that organisations are facing; marketing the office as what they want it to be, not what it is. Another concern for bosses is that remote working makes employees more likely to jump ship for better pay, conditions or career advancement. Turnover is 20% higher than pre-pandemic, according to a Gartner survey, though some of this churn is a result of unemployment at its lowest since 1974, and record vacancy levels putting the power is in employees not employers hands. Cambon argues that hybrid patterns increase loyalty, rather than reduce it. All the data says that if you rescind flexible working, employees will leave. Flexibility is seen not as a perk, but as a right. US tech giant Apple learned this to its cost this summer when it circulated a memo from chief executive Tim Cook telling workers they had to come into the office at least three days a week from September, including Tuesdays and Thursdays. A group of workers launched a petition, saying the move risked stifling diversity and staff wellbeing. At least one high-level employee quit. Ian Goodfellow said he quit as director of machine learning to move to Google partly because of the rivals more flexible working arrangements. While UK companies want bums on seats, few of them appear willing to order attendance as did the US media organisation that monitored turnstiles. Brian Kropp, Gartner chief of HR research, said 43% of firms it surveyed did not track employees presence in the office, and few would fire those who refuse. What happens if someone doesnt show up that often? The response from a good number of companies is, well have a good talk with them to figure out why, Kropp said. And after that good talk if you dont think theyve got a good reason why they are not coming in, what are you going to do, the answer is, well have another good talk with them. Hybrid working also reduces building occupancy, leaving many large corporates mulling how to manage their space when leases come up for renewal. Last week HSBC told staff it was looking at whether to keep its global headquarters in Canary Wharf, where it has been based for more than two decades, after its lease for the 45-floor tower expires in 2027. Those businesses still tied into their leases are debating how to run partly full workspaces this winter as energy bills soar. If you have a lot of office space, its expensive to heat it, Kropp said: A lot of employers have done the math and are saying its just not worth it. One result, according to Kropp, is that companies are planning to switch off heating and power on certain floors, or even on quiet days. What remains unclear is whether the cold weather will do what bosses couldnt: push reluctant staff back to offices to save on their own domestic bills.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/mar\/14\/ukraine-refugee-scheme-uk-homes","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/mar\/14\/ukraine-refugee-scheme-uk-homes","DATE":"2022-03-14 10:29:02","PLAIN_TEXT":"People in the UK can offer to sponsor and house people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine who have obtained a visa through a new government scheme. So far, around 4,000 visas have been issued to Ukrainians with tens of thousands more expected to be provided, according to the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove. The first refugees to use the new route are expected to arrive in the UK by the end of the week, when they will be matched with people offering spaces in their homes. How will it work? What is the scheme? The homes for Ukraine programme allows individuals, charities, community groups and businesses across the UK to offer a room or home rent-free to Ukrainians escaping the war, regardless of whether they have ties to the country. Michael Gove described it as a national effort on behalf of those in desperate need. The scheme follows widespread criticism of the Home Offices slow and bureaucratic approach to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. How do you apply? The UK government has launched a website gathering expressions of interest from potential hosts. How many hosts are likely to get involved? Gove has said he is looking into taking in a Ukrainian refugee and the actor Benedict Cumberbatch said from the Baftas red carpet that he hoped to take part in the scheme. Asked whether he would take part, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said on Monday he was starting to have a conversation with my wife about that, but committed only to helping with the refugee crisis in some way. An Opinium poll for the Observer suggested that almost one in three Britons might be willing to invite a Ukrainian refugee to live with them: 9% said they would definitely do so, while 20% said they might. A previous community sponsorship scheme, largely aimed at welcoming Syrians, has proven relatively slow and bureaucratic with only about 700 individuals receiving such support since 2015. How long can refugees stay? Members of the public can nominate a Ukrainian individual or family to stay with them for at least six months. Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years leave to remain in the UK, and will be able to work, claim benefits and access public services during this period. Will security checks will be carried out? This has yet to be disclosed, but Gove has said steps will be taken to ensure hosts and refugees are prevented from abusing the new scheme. He said security checks would establish whether people are who they say they are and prevent the scheme being exploited possibly by criminal elements, noting that this would only ever be a tiny minority. The Home Office will also check that the people offering up their homes are in a position to provide that support. A spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said the charity did not want to see unnecessary barriers in the process, but added that it is vital child protection is built into every stage of the governments and local authorities response to this crisis. The NSPCC urged the government to work with the foster communities, charities and other partners to ensure the sponsorship scheme is safe. Is there any compensation for hosts? People offering accommodation to Ukrainian refugees will receive a payment of PS350 a month, though this does not increase for additional people. Gove has also said local authority areas will be entitled to more than PS10,000 per Ukrainian refugee using this route to the UK. Additional payments will be available to support school-age children who need to be accommodated within the education system, he said. What have been some of the criticisms of the scheme? The Refugee Council says the UK is not being as welcoming as EU countries, which have waived visa requirements for Ukrainians in the short term. Its chief executive, Enver Solomon, told the Guardian the UK scheme was effectively a managed migration route, which is not suitable to use to respond to a humanitarian crisis. Solomon also said the programme should be only one part of Britains response to the crisis, and urged the government to introduce a properly resourced programme that would enable Ukrainians to live independently in the UK, including access to healthcare and housing benefits. Solomon and the NSPCC have also urged the government to put in place expert mental health support for hosts and guests, since many refugees will be suffering from trauma. Its a bit like asking people to become foster carers without having a social worker in place. There needs to be good quality specialist support otherwise it risks relationships breaking down, Solomon said. There have been also concerns about the tight timeframe, with the NSPCC calling it an ambitious turnaround. Are Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland planning anything different? The first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, have said that as well as taking part in the UK-wide scheme their nations are willing to become super sponsors for Ukrainian refugees to speed up the process and allow large numbers to come to the respective nations more quickly. Sturgeon has urged Westminster to waive all visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals trying to get into the UK, criticising the governments approach so far as beset with bureaucracy and red tape. In Northern Ireland, the Executive Office has strongly encouraged expressions of interest, and these can be made through an online portal due to open on Monday.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2023\/feb\/12\/home-insulation-stop-bills-through-the-roof-energy-efficiency","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2023\/feb\/12\/home-insulation-stop-bills-through-the-roof-energy-efficiency","DATE":"2023-02-12 07:00:16","PLAIN_TEXT":"If you have been working at home this winter in six layers of clothes and a hat, plus an ever-present hot-water bottle, you have almost certainly been wondering how to better insulate your home and make it cheaper to heat. After all, nothing focuses the mind like gas and electricity bills of PS2,000-PS3,000 a year. But have you actually tried to find out in detail how to bring down your bills without spending a fortune on a complete rebuild? I have, and I can tell you that its surprisingly hard to get independent advice that goes beyond trite calls to upgrade your loft insulation. While there are plenty of energy measure installers out there, how do you know if they are any good? Is what they are proposing or selling the best option for your house? Will they still be there in five years time if theres a problem? I decided to have a proper assessment done on our house, and the firm I chose has just come back to me about what options are available - and how much it is likely to cost. There are a number of government and local schemes aimed at helping to make homes more energy-efficient, thereby bringing down bills, although these are typically restricted to certain groups, such as people on low incomes. Miles Brignall outside his home in Hertfordshire. Photograph: Clare BrignallThe Guardian In April, the government will unveil Eco+, a PS1bn scheme that it has previously said will result in hundreds of thousands of homes across the country receiving new home insulation, saving consumers about PS310 a year. It will focus on installing lower-cost measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation. Although the details are still in short supply, the government has said Eco+ is aimed at helping a wider customer base who are now not eligible for support, particularly people in energy-inefficient homes - those with an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of D or below - and in the lower council tax bands. Eco+ will run alongside Eco4, which already offers help to poorer households, and the boiler upgrade scheme that offers PS5,000 to those installing an air source heat pump. Unlike the disastrous green homes grant scheme that it replaces, Eco+ is set, rather worryingly in my opinion, to be carried out by the big energy suppliers - firms that are already understaffed and often struggling to answer the phones to their existing customers. The emphasis looks likely to be on low-cost solutions, when what the UK really needs is something more substantial. So, what happens if your home already has basic insulation, you are not on benefits but you want to cut your bills and your carbon footprint? Does your house need better insulation? Photograph: BrizmakerGetty To put you in the picture, we live in a bog-standard, medium-sized family house that was built on a Letchworth (Hertfordshire) estate in 1980, one of millions of similar homes across the country. It still has the original cavity wall insulation and slightly tired-looking but functioning double glazing. It even has the original 1980 Ideal Concord boiler that is surprisingly efficient and refuses to die. We installed a wood-burning stove - yes, I know - and the loft is fully insulated to the required depth of 300mm. When the heating or the stove is running, its all quite toasty and, despite the age of our boiler, it costs about PS1 an hour to run the heating with only half the radiators and rooms in use - the same as friends who have newer combi boilers. But as soon as the heating goes off in cold weather, as it has been this week, you can feel the temperature dropping. I suspect we need more sophisticated insulation, and ultimately to replace the old boiler and the wood burner; but how, and with what? After what felt like a lot of fruitless phone calls to find an expert, step forward Becky Lane, who runs Furbnow, a firm set up to fill exactly this space in the market. She generously agreed to allow Guardian Money to trial the service and, a few weeks later, one of her home assessors, Adrian, was dispatched to Hertfordshire, where he spent a few hours crawling all over our house. A borescope inspection of our cavity wall soon revealed that much of the insulation material originally put in - probably in 1980 - had slipped and would benefit from being topped up. It might sound counterintuitive - as heat rises - but you can typically save 10-15% with proper floor insulation Furbnows Becky Lane Adrian was somewhat surprised that we were still running a 40-year-old boiler but, as I explained, there didnt seem a lot of point in replacing it with a PS2,500 combi that would last 10 years and give fractional savings in lower bills. So what did Furbnows report say? We got an EPC of D, which was better than I expected. Aside from topping up the cavity wall insulation, which the company says should cost about PS1,500, the most interesting recommendation was to insulate the floors downstairs, which are all solid concrete. I was also told we need better ventilation such as window trickle vents. It might sound counterintuitive, as heat rises, but you can typically save 10-15% with proper floor insulation. It makes sense to put it in at the time you change your carpet or wooden flooring. In your house I would expect it to cost about PS5,000 but it would make a significant difference, Lane says. Her other big recommendation was to install a solar PV (photovoltaic) system on the roof and a battery in the garage, which will bring down our electricity bills and carbon footprint significantly. With a spend of about PS10,600, it looks like we could become about 65% self-sufficient in electricity, saving PS700 a year. This would get our home up to an EPC rating of C - a minimum of where most of us need to be. In the long run, when our boiler does give up the ghost, it probably makes sense to take the governments PS5,000 grant towards installing an air source heat pump at a typical cost of PS10,000.

Photograph: Chris HowesWild PlacesAlamy I had always suspected that we would not be warm enough with an air source heat pump, and that all our radiators would need to be replaced; however, the report suggested that we should be fine with our existing set-up after some energy efficiency improvements. Furbnow offers various follow-up services, and will carry out the work on your behalf using its own verified contractors - which will appeal to many given the reputation of the energy-installing industry. Its staff will also check any quotes the householder gets themselves to make sure the price is fair and that the materials being used are the most suitable, and it is this route I will probably go down. I just need to find the PS12,000 that it will cost to upgrade the basic insulation I have and install the solar panels and battery. I will return to the latter topic in the coming weeks. Furbnow visits by an accredited retrofit assessor start at PS350 plus VAT. In general, consumers should be looking to use MCS-accredited installers when undertaking work in this area.

Cheap cuts: from putting down underlay to closing curtains If you dont have the cash for a green makeover or are renting, there are still cheap, or even free, steps to take to cut energy bills. There are ways to cut your energy bills even if you do not have the cash for a green makeover. Photograph: Carolyn JenkinsAlamy Richard Fitton, a professor in building performance at the University of Salford, says people can save money without retrofitting the whole house, just by following simple energy-saving tips. They are backed by research at No 1 Joule Terrace - the two-up, two-down house built inside a chamber at the university. Called the Energy House, this Victorian property resembles a fifth of UK housing stock and, with more than 200 monitoring points inside, is used to test new technology - from air source heat pumps to smart meters - in real-world conditions. Last month the university unveiled the Energy House 2.0, a temperature-controlled chamber with two new-build homes inside that will be used in a similar way to test the technologies that will make our homes greener and cheaper to run in the future. Take the money saving boiler challenge Unlike the ice bucket challenge, videos of you doing this are unlikely to go viral on social media but turning down the temperature of your combi boiler makes it work more efficiently, and is estimated to save the average household about PS112 a year. Combi boilers work best when they heat the water that goes to the radiators at 60C or below (called the flow temperature); but in most homes they are set at 70-80C. There is a step-by-step guide on how to adjust the temperature on the money saving boiler challenge website. You could walk into your kitchen now and do that change in about 20 seconds and come out with savings of 10% to 15% depending on how your boiler is set up, Fitton says. We did the fundamental research on this [at the Energy House]. Its a really easy one to do and it works. Closing curtains and blinds at night can save 2% on annual heating bills. Photograph: Terry MathewsAlamy Stop heat escaping through the floor If fitting a new carpet or floor, also give serious consideration to what is usually an afterthought: the underlay. It is made up of millions of tiny fibres that act as natural insulators, making it an effective barrier to heat loss. If you put a decent-quality underlay down when you change your carpet, its going to save you about 5% on your energy bills but also increase the thermal comfort in that room, Fitton says. It stops the cold air coming through and keeps the surface warm, so your feet feel nicer, basically. Close the curtains Another simple energy-saving tip given the thumbs up in an Energy House study is catchily titled the thermal performance of window coverings in a whole-house test facility with single-glazed sash windows. Fitton says: By trapping a layer of air between the curtain and the window, it creates a kind of flimsy double glazing-type setup. Drawing your curtains and blinds every night on a typical Victorian terrace like the Energy House is going to save you about 2% of your heating bill every year. Thats just by using the things you already have.Zoe Wood","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2023\/feb\/15\/ofgem-says-temporary-ban-on-forced-prepayment-meters-will-last-six-more-weeks","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2023\/feb\/15\/ofgem-says-temporary-ban-on-forced-prepayment-meters-will-last-six-more-weeks","DATE":"2023-02-15 18:23:30","PLAIN_TEXT":"A ban on the forced installation of prepayment meters will last just six more weeks despite calls from politicians to outlaw the practice. Energy regulator Ofgem has said a temporary ban on installing prepayment meters under warrant would last until 31 March. The prospect of a return to forced installations as soon as April may raise concerns among consumers facing a 40% hike in their bills. Ofgem hurriedly ordered suppliers to halt the practice of forcing customers who fall behind on payments to prepayment meters after the Times reported that debt agents working on behalf of British Gas had ignored signs that customers were vulnerable. British Gas then suspended the tactic, before Ofgem asked all suppliers to stop earlier this month. At the time, Ofgem did not give a date for the conclusion of the ban. This also included a ban on suppliers remotely switching customers on to prepayment tariffs through their smart meter. According to Sky News, Ofgems chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said in a letter to suppliers that they had agreed to our request to immediately halt forced installations and remote transfers to prepayment meters until the end of March 2023. Ofgem has committed to concluding a review on the treatment of vulnerable customers by 31 March, and could extend the ban or make it permanent. An Ofgem spokesperson said this date would be when the new rules will be ready pending our detailed investigation and that it had asked suppliers to halt forced installations until then. The ban will remain in place until the supplier boards can assure us that they are meeting their obligations, the spokesperson said. Suppliers have argued that installing prepayment meters allows them to recover debts and stops consumers amassing larger amounts of debt. Brearley said: We are aware of the difficult balance here as unrecoverable debts from some customers may then be recovered from the bills of paying customers, many of whom are themselves struggling with paying their bills given the wider affordability issue. We have an ongoing programme of work to assess costs to suppliers from customer debt. Once we have analysed your responses to our request for information on debt, we will be able to determine what action we need to take and, if an adjustment is required, we will act quickly. However, Citizens Advice found that 3.2 million people had been left without energy at some point last year after struggling to top up their meter amid the cost of living crisis. An estimated 600,000 people were forced to make the switch away from credit meters after racking up debt with their energy supplier in 2022. The government last week said all UK energy suppliers had agreed to end prepayment meter installation in vulnerable homes. Magistrates have also been asked not to process entry warrants. The Guardian revealed that more than 30,000 warrants had been issued by magistrates since the start of the year. Ofgem has begun preliminary work on a social tariff which could cut bills for low-income households. It is also studying how to reduce the cost of prepayment tariffs to bring them in line with direct debits.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"technology\/2023\/mar\/14\/mark-zuckerberg-meta-layoffs-hiring-freeze","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2023\/mar\/14\/mark-zuckerberg-meta-layoffs-hiring-freeze","DATE":"2023-03-14 13:43:41","PLAIN_TEXT":"Mark Zuckerbergs Meta is laying off another 10,000 people and instituting a further hiring freeze as part of the companys Year of Efficiency, the chief executive announced in a Facebook post on Tuesday. The restructuring, which also sees a further 5,000 unfilled job adverts closed without hiring, comes less than six months after the company announced another wave of 11,000 redundancies. At its peak in 2022, Meta had grown to 87,000 employees globally, with a substantial portion of that hiring occurring since the onset of the Covid pandemic. This will be tough and theres no way around that, Zuckerberg wrote in a blogpost. Over the next couple of months, org leaders will announce restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, canceling lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates. Restructuring and layoffs in Metas tech groups are expected in late April and in business groups in late May. The end goal of the restructure is to improve organizational efficiency, dramatically increase developer productivity and tooling, optimize distributed work, garbage collect unnecessary processes, and more, Zuckerberg said. He highlighted issues including managers with very few staff to oversee and projects he said do not justify the organizational overhead to support them. A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster, he added. People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and fulfilling. We will become an even greater magnet for the most talented people. Thats why in our Year of Efficiency, we are focused on canceling projects that are duplicative or lower priority and making every organization as lean as possible. Zuckerbergs note also hinted at a reversal of the companys moves to promote engineers working from anywhere they want. Our early analysis of performance data suggests that engineers who either joined Meta in-person and then transferred to remote or remained in-person performed better on average than people who joined remotely, he said. Engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in-person with teammates at least three days a week. I encourage all of you to find more opportunities to work with your colleagues in person. Metas stock rose sharply on the news of layoffs, up 5.82% from its open despite turbulence related to the collapse of three tech-focused banks in the last week. In a research note from analysts Jeffries earlier this month, more layoffs had been recommended. We believe more headcount reductions are needed to offset the last two years of excess hiring, it said. More than 100,000 tech workers have been laid off in the first three months of 2023, according a tally kept by TechCrunch, including 12,000 across Alphabet, the parent company of Google, 2,000 at PayPal, 18,000 at Amazon and 10,000 at Microsoft. Twitter has also let go of thousands of staff, in a series of rolling layoffs sparked by Elon Musks October acquisition of the company. But there was no sign of Zuckerberg changing course on one of his most controversial decisions in recent years: plowing billions of dollars annually into the metaverse, a vaguely defined virtual world that is so central to his vision of the future that he renamed the company after it. Related: The metaverse will be our slow death! Is Facebook losing its $100bn gamble on virtual reality? Our leading work building the metaverse and shaping the next generation of computing platforms ... remains central to defining the future of social connection, Zuckerberg said in the blogpost announcing the layoffs. Shortly before the companys November layoffs, some of Metas biggest shareholders had called for Zuckerberg to bail on the project, given the fact that even optimistic projections would not see any investment pay off for more than a decade. Instead, he insisted last year that our long-term vision for the metaverse was an example of a high-priority growth area. With this round of layoffs, however, the founder and chief executive has bowed to pressure slightly, repositioning the metaverse as just one of a number of investments and instead focusing on the current trend in the tech sector: artificial intelligence. Our single largest investment is in advancing AI and building it into every one of our products. We have the infrastructure to do this at unprecedented scale and I think the experiences it enables will be amazing, he said.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2021\/nov\/20\/flexible-working-a-system-set-up-for-women-to-fail","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/nov\/20\/flexible-working-a-system-set-up-for-women-to-fail","DATE":"2021-11-20 07:00:22","PLAIN_TEXT":"Employees want it, employers know they have to offer it; flexible working has transformed almost every office during the pandemic and its here to stay. It is a change that has been demanded for decades by groups including women, those with caring responsibilities and disabled people. But economists and employment experts are warning it could lead to more inequality at the office, particularly for working mothers. The latest to voice concerns was the Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann, who warned of a she-cession, and said women who accept their employers offer of working mostly from home risk damaging their careers, as they arent returning to the office after Covid to the same extent as men. Related: Women working from home risk being caught in a she-cession Mann told an event for women in finance hosted by the newspaper Financial News that technology and virtual working methods couldnt replace spontaneous office conversations that are also vital for career progression. There is the potential for two tracks, she said. Theres the people who are on the virtual track and people who are on the physical track. And I do worry that we will see those two tracks develop, and we will pretty much know whos going to be on which track, unfortunately. Related: Switch to more home working after Covid will make gender inequality worse Traditionally, more women than men - particularly those with children or caring responsibilities - have requested flexible working. Women were found to have taken on more responsibility for household chores during the pandemic, and surveys suggest they also bore the brunt of home schooling. The switch to working from home has, more than 18 months on from the start of the first lockdown, changed a traditional office-based culture for good, even prompting the government to consult on making home working the default option. For some, however, the more flexible approach has resulted in setbacks. Jennifer*, a mother-of-two from Kent, recently returned to her role as a user experience researcher after her second maternity leave. During the pandemic her employer decided to close its London offices, and now rents space in a co-working building. The 38-year-old has opted to work three long days each week and is continuing to work from home, but she worries about missing out. What I have seen is the people who can go, will, and are, doing the networking and having the coffees and the informal chat, and meeting the new CEO. I am very conscious it doesnt feel like something I can easily do, as I need to go and pick up the kids, Jennifer said. Her experience differs vastly from her husbands, who was one of a rare group of remote workers pre-Covid. His company has now shifted to permanent remote working for all employees, which she believes has put him on an equal footing with the rest of the workforce. Hes not a second-class citizen. I also dont get the feeling hes looked down on for being a parent, she said. Anna Whitehouse, a broadcaster and the founder of Flex Appeal, a campaign for the adoption of flexible working across all UK jobs, believes women are disadvantaged because they usually take responsibility for looking after children. I got so frustrated with Catherine Manns comments, that its a female issue, for us to fix, she said. Were obviously going to be taking up more flexible working because of the way the system is, the burden of childcare is still firmly strapped to female shoulders. But thats not to say that there are these hapless dads who dont want to step up to the challenge. Whitehouse, who runs the popular Mother Pukka blog, is calling for families to discuss how they divide up household chores and childcare, and for more men to push for flexible working. We are in a system set up for women to fail, to an extent, and I think we need companies to help us bridge that gender pay gap. Indeed, some campaigners advocate increased uptake of flexible working by men as one way of improving pay disparity, especially given data from the Office for National Statistics which suggests that the gender pay gap widened during the pandemic. Last Thursday marked Equal Pay Day - the date when women effectively begin working for free each year, because on average they are paid less than men - as calculated annually by the Fawcett Society. Flexible working is here to stay, said Andrew Bazeley, the policy and public affairs manager at the society. There are a number of people who will prioritise it in job applications, so in a tight labour market employers will realise they have to offer it, especially if they dont want to widen the gender pay gap. The challenge for managers is that many have not been trained on how to supervise remote workers, according to Ann Francke, the chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute (CMI). Nearly a third (29%) of managers said they felt promotion opportunities would decrease for remote workers, according to a recent CMI poll of 1,200 UK bosses, although 58% said they thought remote working would make no difference to staff prospects. The majority of organisations have not yet done anything to ensure that a home office is not an obstacle. According to the survey, 30% of managers admitted their organisation had not taken steps to ensure employees were not passed over, while 38% did not know. Only a third of (33%) companies had put procedures in place to ensure staff working remotely home workers had an equal shot at future promotions. Even though both men and women wish to work flexibly, of course more women than men will request it, and the implication is they are the ones who will suffer, said Francke. It is extremely important that organisations are not complacent. They need training on judging people and promotions by productivity not presenteeism. * Not her real name","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2021\/jun\/21\/remote-working-office-based-practices-offices-employers","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2021\/jun\/21\/remote-working-office-based-practices-offices-employers","DATE":"2021-06-21 16:33:34","PLAIN_TEXT":"There have been few moments in the history of work as pivotal as the one we find ourselves in now. It took a pandemic to normalise remote working, and, despite the fears of many CEOs, most organisations saw no demonstrable loss of productivity. Now, the global workforce is demanding its right to retain the autonomy it gained through increased flexibility as societies open up again. Pre-pandemic, it was not uncommon for an employer to ask staff to justify their need to work from home. Post-pandemic, employees may ask employers to justify the need to come into the office. Yet many organisations are still resisting this more flexible future. They argue that employees wellbeing is compromised by remote working, and that unless they are brought back into the office, many more will suffer from Zoom fatigue. But remote work itself is not the problem. The problem is that, though most office workers are currently working from home, the way we work is still inherently office-centric. For the past nine months, my team and I have been researching how maintaining this way of working in a remote environment is actually what is causing significant damage to employees. Its never a good idea to force a square peg into a round hole. In todays context, office-centric work is a square peg and the remote environment is a round hole. Pretty much all of our work practices - when we work, where we work, how we work - are designed around location. Worse still, they were designed decades ago, and it is only now, with the pandemic forcing change, that we have been given the unique opportunity to question those structures. Take the when of work. By default, our days are organised around 9-5, a system that was formalised for factory workers by Henry Ford in the US in 1926. Many of us do not work in factories however. Why are we hanging on to this linear day as the only schedule in which work can be done? More importantly, the linear day is unsuitable for the remote environment where we do not have concrete signals to start or end our work day, such as the commute or the dress code: 40% of the remote workforce are working longer hours as a result. What would happen if organisations looked outside this way of working, and trusted employees to set a non-linear schedule, based on their individual circumstances, that kept them healthy, sane and productive? How about the where of work? It is apparent just from the language we use that the office is still viewed as the headquarters for work. Even the term remote implies that you are away from the place work is usually done. The dominance of the office was necessary in a time without home internet or laptops, but we are long past needing to prove that work can be done outside an employer-owned space. The how of work was perhaps the most worrying discovery of our research. There is a long-held assumption that the hallowed meeting is the best way for us to collaborate. This culture of meetings was established in the 1950s, before methods of work that allowed us to collaborate outside meetings (back then, that meant memos passed from one secretary to the next) had todays speed and efficiency (email, instant messaging, shared drives). Virtual meetings are cognitively draining - when was the last time someone held a mirror in front of you during your in-person chat so your brain had to process your every physical move? Forcing us into more meetings to compensate for the lack of office water-cooler moments is only increasing fatigue - our study found that employees are 24% more likely to be emotionally drained by additional meetings. What would happen if we were to work asynchronously by default, and set limits on time spent together during a day, or even a week? It is these outdated, office-centric work designs that are making us tired. We are not working within systems that are built for the environment we are in. And until organisations stop to reassess why we work the way we do, and fundamentally change those aspects that are significantly outdated and not fit for purpose, fatigue will continue to rise. Bringing people back into the office full time isnt the answer - workers dont want to give up the flexibility that gives them greater control of their lives. They want systems that work for the environment they are operating in. In essence, we need to stop designing work around location, and start designing work around human behaviour. Employees will work better, stay at their organisation longer and keep healthier if they are placed at the centre of work design - trust me, we have the data that proves it. This is what we should be asking ourselves: if 9-5 had never been invented; if office were a foreign term; if the concept of a meeting sounded like gibberish - in short, if today were day one of the history of work - how would you design how you work?

The incentive - a dramatic rise from the previous relocation fee of 300,000 yen - will be introduced in April, according to Japanese media reports, as part of an official push to breathe life into declining towns and villages. Although Tokyos population fell for the first time last year- a trend partly attributed to the coronavirus pandemic - policymakers believe more should be done to lower the citys population density and encourage people to start new lives in unfashionable parts of the country that have been hit by ageing, shrinking populations and the migration of younger people to Tokyo, Osaka and other big cities. Related: Im afraid to have children: fear of an older future in Japan and South Korea The payment - which comes on top of up to 3m yen already available in financial support - will be offered to families living in the 23 core wards of Tokyo, other parts of the metropolitan area and the neighbouring commuter-belt prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa. To receive the benefits, families must move outside the greater Tokyo area, although some could receive the cash if they relocate to mountainous areas that lie within the citys boundaries, the Kyodo news agency said, quoting officials. About 1,300 municipalities - roughly 80% of the total - have joined the scheme, hoping to capitalise in a shift in public attitudes towards quality of life that gained momentum during the pandemic, when more workers discovered the benefits of working remotely. Families hoping to secure an easy payday before returning to the capital will be disappointed, however. They must live in their new homes for at least five years and one member of the household must be in work or plan to open a new business. Those who move out before five years have passed will have to return the cash. Officials hope the generous sums on offer will encourage families with children aged up to 18 to revitalise regions and ease pressure on space and public services in greater Tokyo, the worlds biggest metropolis with a population of about 35 million. In principle, relocating families receive 1m-3m yen per household provided they meet one of three criteria: employment at a small or midsize company in the area they move to; continuing in their old jobs via remote working; or starting a business in their new home, according to the Nikkei business newspaper. After the higher payments are factored in, a family with two children could be eligible for up to 5m yen. Half of the cash will come from the central government, and the other half from local municipalities, Kyodo said. The scheme has struggled to capture the public imagination since it was launched three years go, with support provided to 1,184 families in 2021 - the year teleworking became more common - compared with 71 in 2019 and 290 in 2020, the Nikkei said. The government is hoping 10,000 people will have moved from Tokyo to rural areas by 2027, it added. To attract new residents, Japans hollowed-out towns and villages have highlighted the charms of rural life, easy access to undersubscribed childcare and, in the case of Otari village in Nagano prefecture, the availability of eligible men. The latest attempt to reinvigorate the regions comes amid yet another drop in Japans population. The population of the worlds third-biggest economy suffered a record fall of 644,000 in 2020-21, according to government data. It is expected to plummet from its current 125 million to an estimated 88 million in 2065 - a 30% decline in 45 years. While the number of over-65s continues to grow, the birthrate remains stubbornly low at 1.3 children- well below the 2.1 needed to sustain the current population size. In 2021, the number of births totalled 811,604, the lowest since records were first kept in 1899. By contrast, the number of centenarians stands at more than 90,500 - compared with only 153 in 1963.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/25\/number-of-stay-at-home-dads-in-uk-up-by-a-third-since-before-pandemic","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/25\/number-of-stay-at-home-dads-in-uk-up-by-a-third-since-before-pandemic","DATE":"2022-12-25 17:00:07","PLAIN_TEXT":"The number of stay-at-home dads in the UK has leapt by a third since before the pandemic, with experts hailing a monumental cultural shift that has enabled a surge in quality time spent by fathers with their children. One in nine stay-at-home parents are fathers, up from one in 14 in 2019, analysis of the latest Office for National Statistics data shows. The number of dads who had left the workforce to look after their family rose 34% over the same period. Related: The long battle to get Britains lost employees back to work Between July and September this year, 141,000 dads did not have a paid job and stayed at home, compared with 105,000 fathers during the same period in 2019, contributing to the tally of more than 600,000 missing workers since the pandemic. Covid restrictions were an extraordinary catalyst for change in working fathers lives, said Adrienne Burgess, a joint CEO of the Fatherhood Institute. Its analysis shows that the amount of time all fathers spend looking after their kids in Britain has increased by almost a fifth (18%) since 2015, from an average of 47 minutes a day to 55 in 2022. Mothers are working more and fathers are increasing their childcare and housework. When it comes to how we measure gender equality, both of these areas have shown monumental shifts, Burgess said. Stay-at-home dads are still in the minority, but figures show that during the same period the number of stay-at-home mums dropped by 11%. In July to September this year there were 1.2 million mothers out of the workforce due to family reasons, compared with 1.3 million during the same period in 2019. ONS data shows similar trends for men and women whether they have children or not. The number of men who are not currently part of the workforce due to family reasons rose by 5% in October 2022 compared to the same period in 2019, while that of women dropped by 16%. However, compared to last year, women out of the labour market due to family commitments were up by 2.5% - 35,000 up - while the number of men decreased by 1.6% - 4,000 down. Looking after family and home is one of the main reasons for women to be out of the workforce - 28% of the women are out of the labour market due to family commitments compared with just 7% of the men. Robin Lewis, who previously worked in ecommerce marketing, became a stay-at-home dad about 18 months after his lockdown baby Dylan was born. If Id been in the office, I dont think it would have crossed my mind to become a stay-at-home dad, he said. While the experience was often challenging and exhausting, he said, it had been brilliant - and given him a completely different perspective on the challenges that working women face after having a baby. If youve got men being stay-at-home dads and seeing it from the other side, I think thats one of the main ways we can enact change, he said. Interactive The pandemic also appears to have affected the amount of care done by working fathers. In 2014-15, mums in Great Britain spent 86% more time looking after kids than men, which dropped to 13% in March-April 2020, according to ONS data. While the gap has since increased, it is still narrower than before. In March 2022, mothers spent 53% more time taking care of their children than men - a reduction of 33 percentage points in the care gap. Interactive Research shows that the amount of time fathers spend looking after their children in the UK increased steadily from the 1970s until the mid-2000s but then plateaued, Burgess said. Fathers had essentially been trimming time off sleep and personal leisure and looking after their children instead, but by 2015 that had reached its limit of possibilities, she said. It does seem that the pandemic has been the catalyst for change. Scott James Currie, the father of two girls, said he had decided to set up his own architectural design practice from home so he could be more present for his daughters and support his wifes career. I missed so much of our first daughters early years, I was leaving the house at 6am and getting home at 7pm, he said. I just thought: hold on a minute, theres got to be a better way. Now he takes his eldest daughter, Isobel, to school every day, and picks up his 15-month-old, Nella, from nursery - and often works again after bedtime. Every single day, Im involved with my kids more than I was the first time around. And, quite simply, that equates to happiness. Related: Swelling ranks of stay-at-home dads could be pandemics silver lining His experience appears to be echoed in the statistics, which show a significant increase in the number of fathers working from home. Working fathers now spend 6.5 times as much time working from home as they did before the pandemic - they spend more than a third (37%) of their paid work time working from home, compared with 6% in 2014-15. Mums have also upped their working from home hours, but not by as much - they work from home 27% of the time now, compared with 8% previously. Dr Jasmine Kelland, a lecturer in human resource studies at the Plymouth Business School, led a project studying fathers during the pandemic. Dads liked getting to know their children because they were at home for meal times and just more actively involved, she said. She and other academics have noted that society, at last, has started to shift. There has been a real change in what a good father looks like - the archetypal breadwinning father, like in Mary Poppins, has long gone. Now if you want to be a good dad, there is an expectation that you will have an active role in day-to-day parenting, rather than just paying the bills. Despite the protestations of some politicians that workers have to get back to the office, hybrid and work working is here to stay, Burgess said. This is fantastic news for families, she said. If mothers work more, they earn more, the gender earnings gap drops, and it gives them more power.

The UKs biggest companies in the sector - including BT, EE, Vodafone, Virgin Media O2 and TalkTalk - are all preparing to implement above-inflation mid-contract price increases in the spring which mean they will make billions of pounds more annually. Related: Millions of UK mobile and broadband users face 14% bill rises from April The companies calculate the increases using various mechanisms, usually inflation measured by either the consumer prices index (CPI) or retail prices index (RPI) plus an extra increase on top of between 3.4% and 3.9%. In December, the most common month for deciding the rate of rises for the following spring, the CPI was 10.5% while the RPI was 13.4%. This means that customers face increases of between 14% and more than 17% this year. Were taking a thorough look at these types of contract terms to understand fully the extent to which customers truly know what theyre signing up to, and whether tougher protections are needed, said Cristina Luna-Esteban, the director of telecoms consumer protection at Ofcom. Customers need certainty and clarity about what they will pay over the course of their contract. Ofcom said research found that a third of UK mobile and broadband customers do not know that their provider can increase prices mid-contract. Of those that do know, about half have no idea how the rises are calculated. Nearly half of all telecoms customers do not know what CPI and RPI measure. Most mobile and broadband companies added mid-contract price increase clauses in 2021, at a time when inflation was running at only 1.5%. However, with the rate now running at a 40-year high, the rises have a significant impact on finances at a time when household budgets are being stretched by the cost of living crisis. Inflation-linked price rises can be unclear and unpredictable, Luna-Esteban said. So were concerned that providers are making it difficult for customers to know what to expect. At a time when household finances are already under significant strain, it is vital for customers to have sufficient certainty about the prices they will pay over the course of their contract. Even for those who do understand inflation and are aware of its current level, it is not possible for them to know what it will be in the future. The regulator said its review would assess whether tougher protections are needed, with its findings due to be published later this year. Ofcom said consumer law did not prevent telecoms companies from implementing the practice, although it is not allowed in other utility sectors such as electricity and gas. A few telecoms operators use other mechanisms such as giving customers 30 days notice of a price rise, with a right to leave for another provider penalty-free, while others specify fixed rates in contracts at the point of signing. James Fredrickson, the policy director at the broadband firm Hyperoptic, said: Customers should be made fully aware, from the beginning of their sales journey, of what they will have to pay for the length of their deal. There can be no more hiding behind small print. Well be proposing this principle in response to Ofcoms review. The UK advertising watchdog launched its own investigation in September into whether telecoms companies were misleading consumers about inflation-busting bill increases when promoting deals in their marketing campaigns. At a time when household finances are already under significant strain, it is vital for customers to have sufficient certainty about the prices they will pay over the course of their contract, said Ofcom. Even for those who do understand inflation and are aware of its current level, it is not possible for them to know what it will be in the future.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2023\/feb\/23\/png-hostage-freed-australian-professor-researchers-captive-papua-new-guinea-mount-bosavi","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/feb\/23\/png-hostage-freed-australian-professor-researchers-captive-papua-new-guinea-mount-bosavi","DATE":"2023-02-22 23:30:08","PLAIN_TEXT":"A woman who was taken hostage in Papua New Guinea has been released while an Australian professor and two local researchers are still held captive by an armed group in the countrys remote highlands.

It is believed that the university professor, who has New Zealand citizenship but is an Australian resident, was conducting studies near Mount Bosavi with University of Papua New Guinea graduates and guides when they were reportedly confronted by the armed kidnappers on Sunday. Interactive They moved the hostages between villages in the area, an assistant police commissioner for Western End, John Kale, told the ABC. He is concerned that the hostages could be moved again through villages and thick forest. The kidnappers demanded payment from the PNG and Australian governments. Manning described the gunmen as opportunists and the situation as delicate. Negotiations are under way to seek a peaceful resolution. But Manning has said the abductors will be met with a swift security response if anyone held captive is harmed. Failure to comply and resisting arrest could cost these criminals their lives. Missionaries have been working with police on the ground and have spoken to the professor via satellite phone, according to reports. We are continuing to work to strengthen lines of communication, which remains a challenging aspect of this operation, Manning said. He also warned social media users and administrators of social media platforms to refrain from posting false information about the security operation. This came after incorrect rumours claiming that foreign military personnel were involved in the operation began to circulate on social media. The circulation of fake news can complicate security operations leading to tragic outcomes, and I call on people using social media and administrators to not post information that has not been verified by official sources. Manning said the operation to release the captives was under the command of PNG police, alongside the the countrys defence force and domestic security agencies. As one of the captives is a New Zealand citizen with Australian residency, the High Commissions of both countries continue to be briefed on the situation.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2023\/jan\/09\/warm-home-discount-scheme-britain","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2023\/jan\/09\/warm-home-discount-scheme-britain","DATE":"2023-01-09 07:00:09","PLAIN_TEXT":"My wife, who is disabled, received a letter yesterday saying she should contact the government to find out if she is eligible for the warm home discount scheme.We did this and she is. However, when they checked who the utilities account holder was, which is me, because it is not in her name, or a joint account, they said she is no longer eligible.Since I work, and she doesnt, and is incapable of signing her name or even talking at times, I had taken the easy option and set up the utilities accounts in my name, never thinking it could cause a problem.This seems unfair, and since it is backdated to August, changing the account details would not help. My wife is on the priority services register for all utilities so the energy provider knows we live together at the same address. SJ, Shoreham-by-Sea I have discovered that anyone who receives a means-tested benefit such as employment and support allowance (Esa) or jobseekers allowance (JSA) is no longer eligible for the warm home discount if their home is smaller than a certain size. I wonder how many vulnerable people on low incomes this affects? After all, people on low incomes are crammed into small flats by housing associations. I receive Esa so did not get the PS20 a week uplift given to those on universal credit during lockdown - even though universal credit is not yet available where I live. I am fed up with a government that advertises assistance, only to find there is a loophole preventing large numbers of people from claiming it. GR, Nottingham Every year I contact my energy supplier and apply for the warm home discount. I usually complete the form online or by telephone and, without issue, have qualified. When I did not receive this years payment I contacted the DWP and was advised to check my eligibility using the governments online test. Almost immediately I noticed that the form had changed and on completing it received the following notice: You are not eligible ... this is based on the type of property you lived in on 21 August 2022, according to your energy performance certificate. I contacted the helpline and was told a new property component had been introduced, which my home had failed. This new criteria will disqualify tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people from a desperately needed payment. RC, by email The warm home discount scheme has been overhauled by the government and as a result the group eligible for the automatic PS150 rebate on their energy bill this winter has changed and, as these letters show, this has been a big shock to those who relied on the help. As part of the shake-up the list of qualifying benefits changed and a new high energy cost criteria added so the cash is channelled to those on the lowest incomes and in, or at greatest risk of fuel poverty. The positives are most eligible households in England and Wales should get the discount automatically, rather than having to apply as they did in the past and is still the case in Scotland. An extra 780,000 households should receive the rebate, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, boosting the number helped by the scheme to 2.8m. The negatives are that while means-tested benefits, such as Esa and JSA, still qualify, disability living allowance and personal independence payments (which are not means-tested) do not. The latter means more than 500,000 households in England and Wales are now ineligible, according to the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, and Scope. Before the shake-up, working-age low-income households could access the scheme if they were on a qualifying benefit. Now, in England and Wales, they must have a high energy cost score, too. This score is calculated by an algorithm applied to government-held data on the size, age and type of property they live in. This means people struggling to heat old, larger properties are more likely to qualify than those in smaller, new houses and flats that are more energy efficient. As for SJs situation, the rules of the scheme do permit a bill to be in a partners name or that of a Department for Work and Pensions appointee. However, they must also be registered on the eligible persons benefit record. If you are named on your wifes record you should challenge this decision. There is a helpline (0800 107 8002) you can call. If you have been affected by the changes to this scheme there is other help you could try to access as outlined in this recent Money Hacks article.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2023\/jan\/14\/one-eared-rescue-dog-paintings-van-gogh","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2023\/jan\/14\/one-eared-rescue-dog-paintings-van-gogh","DATE":"2023-01-14 08:00:03","PLAIN_TEXT":"When a Connecticut animal shelter struggled to find a home for Van Gogh the one-eared rescue dog, they knew just what to do: break out the canvas and paint.

For him, [painting] is enrichment and a treat. He enjoys doing it. Gartner said there was little interest in Van Gogh after he arrived last summer from a shelter in North Carolina. A suspected bait dog for a fighting ring, he was found abandoned, injured and bleeding in a drainage pipe, leading to the amputation of his left ear. His first in-person art show at the shelter was poorly attended, leading Gartner to place his paintings for sale online. Assisted by a viral TikTok video that attracted 300,000 views, Van Goghs artwork sold out immediately, and he even picked up some private commissions. After seven months with a foster family, Van Gogh also earned an adoption application from his new owner, Jessica Starowitz, who had promised to allow him to continue painting his post-impressionist pieces. Like his 19th-century Dutch namesake, one of the worlds most famous artists who created about 900 oil paintings in his lifetime, including Sunflowers and The Starry Night, the canine Van Gogh is prolific, Gartner said. He has recently completed his 140th work. Starowitz told Fox that Van Gogh had experienced a lot of trauma, and was currently working on his manners and learning to be more comfortable around other dogs. Gartner also said that unlike the real Van Gogh, whose recognition came only after his death in 1890, the dog gets to enjoy the fruits of his labors. He is properly compensated for his work in toys and treats, she said in the video.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/mar\/14\/blue-sky-thinking-new-rules-allow-digital-nomads-to-work-in-the-sun","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/mar\/14\/blue-sky-thinking-new-rules-allow-digital-nomads-to-work-in-the-sun","DATE":"2022-03-14 07:00:03","PLAIN_TEXT":"The pandemic locked us down, but at the same time freed many workers from the confines of the office. A new breed of digital nomads emerged - people who took their laptops, jumped on planes and set up shop in some of the most beautiful parts of the world. And with them have come schemes to make it easier for them to stay for months on end. Barbados was one of the first countries to formalise arrangements with its welcome stamp, launched in June 2020. To qualify, workers must earn more than US$50,000 (PS37,000) during the 12 months they are in the country and pay $2,000 for the application. They will not be subject to income tax while they are there. In June last year, Malta launched a nomad residence permit, with which workers can live in the country once they earn EUR2,700 (PS2,230) a month. Applicants pay EUR300 each, plus the same for each dependant. Iceland has operated a long-term visa for remote workers since October 2020, and Bermuda has a new work from Bermuda certificate. Spain and Sri Lanka have plans to follow suit. The schemes all run in a fairly similar fashion: workers pay to apply and get the right to stay in the country while working for an employer based elsewhere. The visas typically last a year, which can usually be extended once the time is up. Once you have one in place, you can rent a property and travel in and out of the country. However, there are things to bear in mind before you pack your bag. Software developer Alex Lilburn now works in Barbados. Photograph: handout Being a digital nomad can be made to work. However, it is seldom as straightforward as people sometimes think, says Lee McIntyre-Hamilton of Keystone Law, who specialises in global mobility. Obtaining a visa is just the start of the process. Alex Lilburn, a software developer, moved from the UK to Barbados in January 2021 after making his application for the welcome stamp. I saw a piece on the BBC headlined something like: Working remotely? You could be working from paradise, he says. The article mentioned Barbados, so he started looking into the practicalities. I worked from home before, but suddenly there was no expectation from clients that we would turn up once a month, he says. I spoke to my employer . They were very supportive and said if there were no tax implications, they would help make it happen. If you are employed, you may be contractually obliged to work where your employer says, and being overseas might not be an option. Moving away could trigger obligations for your company, says McIntyre-Hamilton, such as the payment of social security contributions in the new country. For example, if a UK citizen and employee of a UK company went to live and work in Spain indefinitely, they would immediately trigger an obligation for their UK employer to register as a foreign employer and operate a payroll there, he says. Your presence may also prompt a corporate presence for the company overseas and, with it, demands for corporate tax. So this is not something you can do without consulting with your employer. Its more straightforward if you are self-employed, but you should talk to your clients, says McIntyre-Hamilton, as in some cases contractors - especially when they only have one client - could be considered an employee under different rules in the new country. Barbados offers a zero income tax rate for those on its welcome stamp, but you will pay VAT on goods and services. Lilburn is paid by his employer in the UK, and it takes out income tax and national insurance as if he was still working at home. In general, tax rules around residency are complicated, especially if you are travelling for a short period and may make trips back to the UK. Whether or not you pay tax in the UK depends on whether you are a UK tax resident. Broadly, HM Revenue &amp; Customs says that if you are in the UK for 183 days or more in a tax year, you are resident. But residency is complicated and travellers should go through the statutory residence test for clarity. If an individual remains a UK resident when they are living and working overseas, HMRC will continue to tax any income that the individual earns while they are living and working overseas, says McIntyre-Hamilton. You may also be subject to taxes in the country you are staying in - leading to the possibility of being taxed twice, although there are exemptions where there is a double tax treaty with the UK. Even if you are not resident in the UK, any money sourced there - such as bank interest, dividends or rental income - will typically be subject to UK income tax. I have seen some evidence of digital nomads moving from country to country in the expectation that this will avoid triggering issues in any one country. Generally, this assumption is incorrect, says McIntyre-Hamilton. Lilburn has no intention of moving. Its great work-wise, he says: the time difference is currently four hours, and he has meetings in the morning when his UK colleagues are at their desks, then does his coding work in the afternoon. He recently renewed his welcome stamp for another year, which was slightly cheaper than the original application, at $1,500, and says he can see no reason why he wont do the same again next year. I came to Barbados for the scenery and weather, but Im staying for the people - whether its the other people on the visa, who are similar people at the same life stage, or the Bajans Ive met who have been so friendly, he says. Its amazing, it really is. Bermuda visa says welcome Lauren Anders Brown is a documentary maker who was visiting her partner in Bermuda in March 2020 when the pandemic hit. She ended up staying, and that summer, applied for the islands digital nomad visa. It costs $285 to apply but it was simple, she says. You have to prove your overseas company pays you into a bank account, that you are paying your taxes, and that you have health insurance. Shes self-employed with Collaborate: ideas &amp; images, in the UK. She earns into accounts in the UK and the US, where she is originally from, and uses accountants to make sure she has paid the right tax. Her partner is a doctor, and applied for a traditional working visa. It was a hell of a lot easier for me to stay than him, she says, because the digital nomad visa is a new kind of immigration law. Non-residents are not allowed to drive, but under the scheme she is. She was also able to rent a place to live while he was still getting his visa approved. Bermudas only downside is it is expensive. The visa lasts a year and she has renewed it. Theres blue water, its dog-friendly - it really suits us, she says.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2023\/mar\/19\/the-great-resignation-led-to-big-regrets-so-should-we-all-be-career-committing","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/mar\/19\/the-great-resignation-led-to-big-regrets-so-should-we-all-be-career-committing","DATE":"2023-03-19 14:00:41","PLAIN_TEXT":"Fancy looking after a Hebridean island or counting penguins in Antarctica?

I was one of the lucky ones, because I managed to spend my sons early years as a part-time stay-at-home dad. And I was able to do this because my chosen profession, journalism, was one of the first to embrace - or at least allow - working from home. I could get away with freelancing and organising work around my caregiving time. The experience taught me so much. I learned how to survive as an independent parent, rather than simply a mothers assistant. I got to know my son inside out. We built a bond that still feels unbreakable. But when I look back, I realise how isolated and unsupported I was. Twenty years ago, stay-at-home fathers were a very rare animal. We didnt even have statutory paternity leave. Because of this I never fully came out as a highly involved father to my freelance clients. It felt safer to present myself as being so in demand work-wise that I had limited capacity to take on certain jobs, even if the reality was that Id deliberately blocked out half my calendar for fathering. This sense of being torn between conflicting identities - worker and solo caregiver - will be familiar to many mothers, who are more likely to step back from their career in early parenthood. But I felt a gendered stigma too - one which even now few employers do much to address. I also received little recognition or support from public services. Health staff routinely met my gaze as if they had one finger on the panic button when I took my son for appointments. I remember a GP spending precious minutes quizzing me about where Mum was, as my son lay limp in my arms with what I feared might be meningitis. Twenty years on, new polling data shows that substantially more men are experiencing life as a stay-at-home dad. This appears to have accelerated during lockdown, when fathers across the UK found they had time to involve themselves more deeply in looking after their children. Among partnered fathers full-time at home during lockdown, 85% spent more time with their children, 73% more time on home schooling and helping with homework; and 72% more time on cleaning, laundry and cooking. Most (73%) said their relationship with their child had improved. We also now have official data from the Office for National Statistics confirming that in April 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 restrictions, working fathers were spending 88% of the time working mothers spent on unpaid childcare - up from 54% in 2014-15. We also know that in March 2022, after the main Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, this crucial metric didnt fall back fully; it settled at 66%. Whats changed? The new data shows that working fathers in March 2022 spent more than a third of their paid work time working from home - up from just 6% in 2014-15. And the time these men spend on travel has also dropped, by a whopping 41%. Related: The struggle of fatherhood is real - so why are new dads often invisible in NHS advice? | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett Fathers, then - and not just stay-at-home fathers - are much more around. Just like I was 20 years ago, as an early adopter of home working. Many dads are already voting with their feet, doing more of the hands-on, unpaid work that tends to fall more on mothers shoulders. More would surely join in, given the right policy nudges. The big question is, who are the politicians and commissioners of public services prepared to recognise and support this monumental shift? Who will see families as they are - rather than, as now, viewing mothers as the only parent worthy of tax-funded leave and services? The state currently pays employed fathers just two weeks paternity leave at less than the minimum wage, and only if theyve been with the same employer for long enough. Self-employed or gig-worker dads get nothing. Almost all babies (95%) are registered to two parents: almost always a mother and father. Yet fathers have no status as patients of maternity and other perinatal services; theyre treated as visitors, rather than central members of a new family who might need support. Take-up of shared parental leave - which theoretically allows fathers to take time off in their babys first year - is tiny, with many organisations calling for the scheme to be replaced. And it will still be up to parents to dare to ask for flexible working, rather than employers to advertise such options, even if the right to request will soon be available from day one of employment. As a sole or main breadwinner dad, would you risk it? Surely hands-on childcare is now such a key aspect of how men do - and want to do - fatherhood, that it provides a platform for politicians to connect more closely with mens and womens lives and identities in a new way? With strong political leadership, the UK could have father-friendly policies, public services and workplaces, to benefit everyone. Involved fathers represent a social change that has been hidden in plain sight for decades. Just look around you, were everywhere.

Tired babies do not, as I had expected, just nod off. Nor do all newborns love the car (mine screamed with such ear-shattering persistence we had to stop driving). But ask any expectant parent about the state of British childcare and you will settle upon a seemingly universal understanding: the system is woefully unfit for purpose. After a Brexit exodus decimated staffing levels in nurseries, the pandemic quietly pushed the early years sector past the point of no return, and this winter promises even more hardship. Deliberate underfunding means providers have little choice but to charge astronomical fees, which have increased at a rate that far outstrips wages, to cover their own sizeable outgoings. And as energy prices rise, so too will costs. Trying to find a nursery place for my daughter this year revealed just how depleted the provision is, with 18-month waiting lists as standard, and some waits so long their lists were closed. Demand far outstrips supply, thanks to a staffing crisis that shows no signs of abating as low-paid workers jump the sinking ship in favour of better pay and less stressful jobs. Between 2021 and 2022, the number of childcare providers in England plummeted by 4,000, and 86% of early years providers say the government funding they receive for three- and four-year-olds does not cover the cost of delivering those places. One nursery owner in the north-east tells me: I havent been able to pay myself since November 2021 ... Ive had to take a second job just so I can live. It doesnt take much creativity to imagine how this crisis is spilling over into the lives of mothers - and I say mothers, because it is women who are being disproportionately impacted by this broken system. I know Im not the only one who compares my wages each month with the cost of childcare, and wonders if the stress of juggling both, only to be barely breaking even, is worth it. Nearly three-quarters of part-time workers are women, and 57% of them feel they have no choice but to work part-time. Friends share their own nightmare stories: one in full-time work texts to say her childs nursery is closing its doors permanently with just a weeks notice due to staffing shortages, leaving her scrambling for childcare cover. Another says their nursery, struggling to cope with rising energy bills, is suddenly charging an extra PS10 a day for lunch and activities. But this winter, as household costs continue to rise, things could become even more dystopian. In the past year, the number of women not working in order to look after family has risen by 5% - a trend-bucking increase the likes of which hasnt been seen for 30 years, with women between 25 and 34 most affected. Put simply, too many women can no longer afford to work. And as the cost of living and energy crises bite, this steady stream of mothers disappearing from the workforce threatens to build to a raging torrent. Florencia is being forced to make a maddening choice between working and staying afloat. She and her husband employ a nanny to look after their two-year-old daughter, who has special needs, while they both work. With the spike in costs, we can no longer afford [the nanny] so I have decided to take time off, she tells me. Laura, a 39-year-old Canadian who has two children, left her staff job at a top London university this year. After paying for childcare, she says, she wasnt even breaking even. It was like, is it even worth working? Lauren, also 39, has been unemployed since she was made redundant during the pandemic. I cant afford to pay for a nursery until I get a job, and I cant seriously look for a job without childcare, she says. My husband works, but were in our overdraft every month now as things are getting more and more expensive. She says that her sense of identity has suffered from not being something other than someones mum, or wife. These stories should frighten us all - they point to a growing trend of working mothers being pushed by force and en masse back into the home. Too hyperbolic? I dont think its an exaggeration at all. I think this is exactly what were seeing, says Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed. These are women who want to work but have no viable means of doing so, who are being failed by decades of government shortsightedness. People still do not grasp this notion that if you invest in the childcare sector, youre investing in the economy, because it enables people to work, says Brearley. What they think is: My taxes are paying for your children. And thats not fair. At the end of this month, more than 10,000 families are set to participate in mass protests over political inaction on the issue. And its about time. Investing in childcare could boost the annual income of working mothers in the UK by PS10bn, according to a study by the Centre for Progressive Policy. That translates to an additional 3% in their economic output - surely something even the most fiscally or liberally conservative governments can recognise as a positive. But for now, says Mary-Ann Stephenson of the Womens Budget Group, its a bleak picture. If women cant afford childcare they either depend more on informal care from their families, which can lead to older women leaving the workforce, or they can only work part-time reduced hours, or they leave the labour market altogether. Government proposals to reduce staff-to-child ratios in nurseries as a way to reduce fees are largely unsupported by providers and parents alike. I ask the nursery owner whether it will make any difference for nurseries already operating at a loss. Not a chance, she tells me: Theres no nursery in the land thats going to be able to reduce their fees. Related: I asked Boris Johnson about the childcare crisis. His response? More Tumble Tots | Justine Roberts As more working mothers are pushed to the fringes, the consequences will be felt in the gender pay gap - the monitoring of which is itself at risk. And in the long term, more and more women of retirement age will sleepwalk into poverty without the opportunity to build up healthy pensions during their working years. But work is also about identity. It is an anchor to society, a reflection of our self-worth, a life raft of normality when family life threatens to consume us. Theres a reason those chintzy gin and tonic - mummys little helper signs are so commonplace - a glib expression of just how awful it can be to be a stay-at-home parent. It should no longer be taboo to say that lots of mothers have no desire to stay at home, and that many children benefit from being looked after in organised childcare settings. Generations of women, not hundreds, but millions - from the very youngest, to the very oldest - are being failed. And slowly but surely, we are rolling back the clock on equality.

The 55-year-old felt she had bonded with her new colleagues online and looked forward to meeting them face-to-face once the lockdown was over. But when she finally went into the office, she had a nasty realisation. I strongly suspect that they would not have hired me, had they met me in person during the interview process, she said. Alexandra now believes she was employed 15 months ago thanks to a misapprehension about her age: having experienced ageism in early job searches, she had scraped her CV clean of any clues to her age. Now I understand the chemistry of the office, I am certain that I only got the job because the process was virtual and I look younger than I am, she said. My much younger colleagues treat me completely differently now theyve met me in person: they sideline me, I have to listen to them slagging off anyone over the age of 40 and joking about the menopause. Alexandra isnt sure how much more she can take. I do wonder whether I will be able to stay for the long haul, given more personal and out-of-hours interaction is necessary than when we were working remotely, she said. Lockdown policies introduced to mitigate the pandemic had profound effects on the labour market. When the UK fell into recession in August 2020, employment fell by the largest amount since the 2009 financial crisis. But for those determined to find new jobs, opportunities existed: in the first three months of 2021, the British Chambers of Commerce found that 40% of businesses were looking to recruit, compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 average of 55%. But what is the return to office life like for those hired remotely during lockdown, who have never visited their new workplace, seen their colleagues face-to-face or met the boss who hired them? Helen, a 29-year-old software developer in London, also wonders if she would have been hired last September if the process hadnt been conducted remotely. She started going into the office a couple of months ago. Im a woman in a male-dominated industry - and the only woman on my team, she said. When we were working remotely, I think the fact that I didnt fit in was masked by the sort of formality that was imposed by virtual meetings. Or perhaps all the lads have been having lots of fun in direct messages on Slack all this time and I wasnt aware of the party I wasnt invited to, she added. Who knows? For Jackie, who managed her new team remotely for a year after joining a new company, trying to transition to face-to-face management has been a struggle. Ive spent a year building relationships with my team over Zoom but now weve met, we dont really know how to act around each other. Its like visiting a new country and trying to learn about the culture, while being trapped in a hotel room and only seeing people out of the window, she added. Justine Bibby said she felt like the new girl all over again on returning to the office. Photograph: HANDOUT Justine Bibby, a director and consultant at UBS, feels the same. Despite being an employee for over a year, I feel like the new girl all over again, she said. It was great - but weird - to finally meet in person some of the people Id been talking to over Skype. And I didnt realise how much I missed those spontaneous, casual office chats. But Ellie, a 30-year-old who works in marketing, discovered that in her case, working relationships formed online proved flimsy when transferred into the real world. I genuinely believed I had developed good relationships through video calls and chat platforms but when I saw how people interacted with each other when they had known each other pre-pandemic, I suddenly realised how much I was missing out on. I dont feel comfortable around my colleagues, she admitted. Its awkward: weve realised that we dont have anything in common.  Starting a new job remotely has convinced Kate Tinker, who got her new job nine months ago, that its impossible to successfully integrate into a new workplace without physically being in that workplace. My first few months in the office felt quite discombobulating, she said. I felt some major detail of meeting people had been missed and, although I had worked within the company for four months, I was stuck in this in-between of knowing my co-workers without actually having met them. I now choose to be in the office almost every day, But the other new recruit who started with me promptly left after six months for an entirely remote role. Anwen, however, feels that if that bonding doesnt happen at the start of a job, its almost impossible to establish later. I started my new job during the first lockdown, so Ive been working remotely for 1.5 years, she said. But as I gradually begin to spend time in the office, it was stark how few friendships I had at work. Being new but not new is an uncomfortable and isolating feeling, she said. I have found it difficult to build bonds or relationships with my colleagues and am currently looking for a new role: Id like the opportunity to start afresh. Related: UK staff to gain right to request flexible working from day one For others, however, working from home gave them a confidence boost - and returning to work gave them another step up. Elliot felt he was thriving when working remotely. Thats basically what gave me the confidence to apply for a much more senior role at a much bigger institution, on a way higher pay band, in a different field. And I got it! he said. But starting a new job remotely felt very different. I felt isolated, ineffective and incompetent, he said. When he returned to the office, it was amazing. I got loads of work done. It felt great to be able to see and speak to people Ive never met in person before, and explore a workplace Ive never previously seen. Im going back in full-time now, even though I dont really need to.

To Gareth Jones, a council housing enforcement officer, the stinking hillocks of rubbish are tell-tale signs of illegal, overcrowded dwellings. Jones picks his way up steps to the front doors of flats constructed hodge-podge over the back of an interwar shopping parade. His colleague, Sheetal Rajani, slaps on one door loudly and Anand, a shop worker answers. Rajani enters first and points straight to a hole in the ceiling where the smoke alarm should be. Oh my goodness, she says, turning into a cramped bedroom. A gas boiler hangs on one side of the bed, a gaping electrical socket with exposed wiring on the other. The ceiling hangs too low and in the back bedroom, where Anand and his wife and child share a small double bed, drying racks clog the space. There are fire risks, the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning, breaches of building regulations and possible overcrowding. The bill for the privilege of living here: PS1,200 a month. Anand and his familys home poses multiple serious risks to their health. Photograph: Martin GodwinThe Guardian Landlord make money only, says Anand. Thats it. Were here to help you, says Rajani. We want you to live in good conditions. Rajani and Jones are on the frontline of a nationwide housing safety crisis, simmering for years, but now finally attracting attention of the housing secretary Michael Gove after the scandalous death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak in Rochdale. He died from respiratory failure caused by chronic mould that was not treated by the landlord. This week it was reported two infants in south-east London have been hospitalised after living in a mouldy council flat. Greenwich council said it has given the young family medical priority to move. Cold weather and soaring energy bills are likely to worsen the problem of mould. One in 10 private rented homes have damp, according to the last English Housing Survey. After reassuring Anand, Rajani begins the hunt for the landlord asking in newsagents and snack bars, flashing her council ID like a police badge. She will track him down, and issue an enforcement notice. In this part of Harrow, the borough requires landlords to be licensed and if they are not they can be fined PS5,000. Its definitely a category one, she says, alluding to the governments risk ratings for housing. It means Anands home - where a child is being brought up - is serious and immediate risk to a persons health and safety. In 2021 3.4m homes in England failed to meet the governments decent homes standard - equivalent to 14% rising to almost one in four private rented homes. And 2.2m homes feature at least one category one hazard. In Harrow, there have been an increasing number of complaints. Energy is so expensive at the moment that the last thing you want to do is waste it opening the windows, Jones says, adding that others keep the heating off. Rooms in unlicensed houses of multiple occupation (HMO) rent from PS600 a month to PS1,000 if they have an en suite bathroom. Its big business, says Rajani. In another part of the borough she slaps the door of another house that has attracted complaints. When a young woman answers and says the house is occupied by a family, Rajani is sceptical. The occupants, all young adults with very little furniture (some sleep on the floor) claim there are five of them. But in the bathroom there are 10 toothbrushes. There is penetrating damp and the home costs them a combined PS2,000 a month. It is probably overcrowded and there are fire hazards. The inspectors take the landlords number. As we walk between inspections Jones explains that a spate of recent cases has involved homes occupied by families with leaking roofs or no electricity and the inspectors have been able to take the properties out of use and get people rehoused somewhere safe. Its one of the reasons I love the job so much, said Jones. Youre making a difference to peoples lives.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/jan\/11\/working-from-home-alienates-us-from-our-fellow-human-beings","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/jan\/11\/working-from-home-alienates-us-from-our-fellow-human-beings","DATE":"2022-01-11 17:50:10","PLAIN_TEXT":"In his piece (Working from home has entrenched inequality - how can we use it to improve lives instead?, 9 January), John Harris rather glosses over one of the most vital aspects of having a collective workspace: the importance of social interaction and discourse, for our wellbeing as social animals.

Only a few days ago, there was an article about new supermarkets where we have no interaction with people at all; we simply take goods off the shelves and walk out. For many, the workplace is vital for meeting people outside our family circles, a place where we can exchange ideas about work and life in general, banter and form close relationships.

From July to October, much of Australia was in lockdown with the work from home (WFH) arrangements to match. Since then, you might have gone back to the office full-time, kept logging on to your morning Zoom meetings from the dining room table, or adopted a hybrid setup. So what impact do those ever-changing work arrangements have on our tax returns? With 30 June just a couple of days away, heres a brief rundown of what you can - and cant - claim as we navigate the new nine-to-five. default What if you split your time between home and office? This year, the ATO is again offering a simplified way to claim WFH costs. Its called the shortcut method, and was first introduced last financial year because of the pandemic. The shortcut method allows you to claim 80 cents an hour for every hour spent working from home. The catch is that it encompasses absolutely everything you might want to claim - your phone, internet, electricity, gas, furniture, computer, printing, and stationery. You cant make any additional claims for home office costs on top of that 80-cent rate. Related: What expenses can I claim on my tax return if Im working from home? For that reason, you may be better off sticking with the original method for claiming WFH costs, known as the fixed rate method. It allows you to claim 52 cents an hour for every hour spent working at home - and your phone, internet, computer products, printing and stationery costs as well. (Your furniture, electricity and gas, though, are already included in the 52 cent rate.) Ive done about 3,000 tax returns in the last two years and the fixed rate method will work out favourably for the majority of people, says Helen Francis, an accountant who is also known as The Tax Mermaid. Brendan Campbell, an accountant at Prosperity Wealth Advisors, agrees it is typically the better option. Claiming the fixed rate method will, however, require you to figure out what percentage of your phone and internet usage was work-related, so that you can claim only that amount - whats known in the tax world as apportioning. If you can go to the effort of working out that, it would mean a better claim for you, Campbell says. But if not, claim the 80 cents per hour. Its better than not claiming anything. Im back to the office now. Can I claim that computer I bought in July? As long as youre using the fixed rate method for your WFH expenses, then yes. However, you might not be able to claim the full cost in one go. Items over $300 need to be depreciated, which means that you claw back the cost of it over a few years across the products lifespan. And youll probably need to do some apportioning. That shiny new computer you bought for work at the start of lockdown and now only use to stream Netflix, for instance? Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning. The claim is going to be quite small, because you start the depreciation in July and youve got to stop it in October when youre no longer using that computer solely for work, says Francis. So if youre claiming a $2,000 computer, firstly, it needs to be depreciated over probably three years. Thats already limiting your claim, then youve got to cap it at only the four months we were lockdown, because thats the only time you were using it. So the claim will be quite small. It wont be the whole cost of the computer. Is my commute deductible now? Sorry, but no. You can never claim commuting to and from the office, pre- or post-pandemic, says Francis. Its not an allowable deduction. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule. One is for those who have to carry bulky equipment to work - this typically applies to tradies, but could also include teachers who have to bring in a lot of class supplies on the first day of school. The other is if youre travelling between two places of work, like driving from the office to an off-site meeting. But that doesnt typically apply to those opting to split their time between home and the office. Checking a few emails and doing an hours work at home, then travelling to the office would not normally constitute travel between two places of work, Campbell says. Whereas if someone was required to work from home in the morning and then required to come into the office halfway through the day, then that trip would be deductible. The emphasis would be around required. Australians who genuinely must drive to meetings in their own car or transport bulky equipment can claim 72 cents a kilometre for work-related trips to help cover the cost of fuel. That rate, sadly, hasnt gone up with the rapidly rising price of petrol this financial year. Heres something new: you can now claim your RATs One small gift from the ATO this year is the ability to claim black those very expensive rapid antigen tests. If, of course, you were swabbing yourself for work-related purposes. They have to be specifically work-related RATs - you have to be taking them in a circumstance that will either allow you or not allow you to go to work, says Francis. So it cant be one that youve purchased to go out on a Saturday night. Its got to be work-related and not already reimbursed by your employer. And yes, you need [to have kept your] receipts. Similarly, if you had to buy your own PPE, masks or hand sanitiser to go to work, you can claim those expenses as well. The things you cant claim You might be tempted to take liberties with those WFH expenses. But thats probably not a good idea, Francis says. Related: Cryptocurrency and tax: could you end up paying the ATO more than you earned? A lot of people have taken the piss a little bit, claiming couches and furniture thats not really home office-related. Theres been some people claiming athleisure wear because thats what they wear while theyre working. One guy wanted to claim his lawn mower because he was sitting outside to work, she laughs. But the tax office is all AI. So if youve claimed something thats not really related to the occupation code you listed in your tax return, youll be flagged for an audit. And be wary of copy-pasting in old info from pre-pandemic years, on top of claiming your new WFH expenses. What theyre looking at this year is claims that dont really make sense, Francis says. Like, if youd been working from home full time but then youve got $5,000 worth of car expenses, then thats going to flag. The deduction tax agents want you to know about Its not pandemic related, but there is one dependable way to lower your tax bill: make a voluntary super contribution. Thats my favourite way to do it, because youre not actually wasting your money on things that you might not need in a few months time and youre investing in your retirement, Francis says. Sweetening the deal, the ATO even increased the amount you can make as a voluntary contribution this year from $25,000 to $27,500. Theyre also now allowing you to carry forward any unused voluntary contributions if your super balance is under half a million dollars. So if youve not maxed out your voluntary contributions in previous years, you can catch those up and claim those this year or next year, Campbell says. There is one caveat: To be deductible this year, any contributions must be received by the fund by June 30. That means you cant really make payments on June 30, because the fund wont receive them in time. So if you want to claim that sweet super tax break this year, youd better hop to it.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2023\/jan\/02\/quiet-quitting-trend-2023-great-resignation","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2023\/jan\/02\/quiet-quitting-trend-2023-great-resignation","DATE":"2023-01-02 11:00:13","PLAIN_TEXT":"It started, as many trends do now, with a TikTok. I recently learned about this term called quiet quitting where youre not outright quitting your job, but youre quitting the idea of going above and beyond, a man calmly narrates over footage of New York City. Youre still performing your duties, but youre no longer subscribing to the hustle culture mentality that work has to be your life, the voice continues as a clip showing a hand playing with bubbles out of a bubble machine. Between 13% and 20% of Americans are reportedly actively disengaged at work The video got over 400,000 likes and soon after it seemed like everyone was talking about quiet quitting, the hot new trend. As summer turned into fall, more TikToks were created, talkshows featured jokes on the phenomenon, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg published over a dozen articles on quiet quitting. The talkshow titan Dr Phil dedicated a full TV episode to it. Now, as a new year begins, the stream of TikToks has slowed. Google searches for the term quiet quitting have dropped. Business Insider declared RIP, quiet quitting with reports that workers are back to the 50-hour work-week grind after some companies, particularly in tech, started laying off workers and freezing open roles. But while quiet quitting looks like another here today, gone tomorrow viral trend, amid the current economic environment, the ethos that quiet quitting represents for workers is probably here to stay, say experts. Even if it is not neatly packaged in alliteration. Related: Quiet quitting? Everything about this so-called trend is nonsense | Tayo Bero Quiet quitting was never really new. Between 13% and 20% of Americans have reported being actively disengaged at work since Gallup started conducting employee engagement surveys in 2000. To some, quiet quitting is just working - do your job, go home and forget about it. That something many people had always done - not volunteering for extra grind - was treated like a new trend shows how much the Covid-19 pandemic has influenced the relationship people have with their jobs. The pandemic made many people reassess their priorities. Had they been putting work before family, friends, their own health? The shift has even been acknowledged by the US surgeon generals office, which in October released guidance around workplace health and wellbeing that encouraged managers to listen to workers, increase pay and limit communication outside work hours, among other things. Today, more and more workers are worried about making ends meet, dealing with chronic stress and struggling to balance the demands of both work and personal lives. The toll on their mental health is growing, the US surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, said in the guidance. The pandemic ... sparked a reckoning among many workers who no longer feel that sacrificing their health, family and communities for work is an acceptable trade off. Cristina Banks, director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces at the University of California at Berkeley, said the emergence of quiet quitting speaks to the drop in personal drive around work, partly due to ongoing burnout. Related: Quiet quitting: why doing the bare minimum at work has gone global Quiet quitting makes a lot of sense. People are losing that intrinsic motivation and not wanting to work as hard as they did before, Banks said. While the Covid-19 exacerbated loss of motivation, workers were already starting to feel detached from their work in the years before the pandemic. Before the pandemic, there were unrealistic expectations of what people were supposed to do in their jobs, to go above and beyond what theyre paid to do or push themselves to the limit, she said. People dont want to go back to the workplace, to go under that same pressure cooker. In his book The Importance of Work in an Age of Uncertainty, the Boston College professor David Blustein reports that even before the pandemic, people were already experiencing a sense of uncertainty about work, a sense that the institution of work was eroding. Workers over the last 50 years have lost more and more autonomy and protection and have been treated like commodities, Blustein said. Organizations have really put profits and productivity at the forefront, and I think people really feel it. A 2015 paper estimated that workplace stress from layoffs, job insecurity and toxic work cultures could be causing over 120,000 deaths and $190bn (PS156bn) in healthcare expenses a year. And this was before the pandemic, when the risk of getting Covid-19 at work did not exist. For workers who could do their jobs remotely when the pandemic started in spring 2020, it gave some a break. The experience of people working productively without all the excess of mental challenges, physical challenges, organizational challenges that they met when they were at the office gave them a different view of how they can live their lives and work in the future, Banks said. Blustein sees quiet quitting as a companion to the Great Resignation, which saw the national quit-rate rise from 1.6% in April 2020 to 3% in November 2021 - the highest rate since the government started tracking quit numbers. Over 47 million Americans quit their job in 2021. In a survey of quitters, Pew found most cited low pay, opportunities for growth and feeling disrespected as the top reason for quitting. Quiet quitting is part of a larger picture of this being a period of rethinking the institution of work, Blustein said. The pandemic was really a trigger point for working people. This was the case for Ken, a high school teacher in Iowa, who wished to be identified by a pseudonym for fear of professional repercussions. When the pandemic forced classes to go remote, it ended up offering a glimpse at what work-life balance could be. Once Ken came back to teaching in-person, he started to quiet quit, though the term had not been invented yet. He held off on staying up late doing grades and saved his energy for family and friends. He thought of fewer fun activities to do for his class and no longer stayed late to chat with students. While the more fulfilling relationships that came with teaching are gone, Ken said it was necessary to get some of his personal life back. Related: Get off the hamster wheel! How to quiet quit absolutely everything Im kind of realizing I miss having friends, I miss actually having quality time with my family when Im not totally drained, he said. The pandemic gave a lot of a teachers a chance to just be like, Wow, I really enjoy having family time and not feeling exhausted. In a survey released by the National Education Association in February, 55% of educators were thinking about leaving the profession earlier than planned. Ken said he is ultimately switching careers at the end of the year and is quiet quitting to bide his time. Teachers are supposed to be [students] counselor, their second parents, their police officers, he said. Were getting paid nowhere near what would be required of that. Thats the biggest thing for burnout, requiring us to do so many different, enormously important jobs. Though quiet quitting may not be the trend it once was, Blustein thinks its manifestation points to something larger that will probably stick around. People really are rethinking their relationship with work, he said. We dont know where this is going to land, and it may not really land. It may continue to be a very organic, dynamic process.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/dec\/27\/tuesday-briefing-how-the-cost-of-living-crisis-really-hit-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/dec\/27\/tuesday-briefing-how-the-cost-of-living-crisis-really-hit-home","DATE":"2022-12-27 06:45:16","PLAIN_TEXT":"Good morning.

I live on my own - I can go without putting the heating on ... Ive never ever had to do anything like this in my life. Steve Bowater, 52, NHS delivery driver, Sheffield *** April: prepaid meter users are first to feel the impact of price cap rise Im really quite frightened. There are times previously when Ive run out of credit on my meter and just had to sit in the dark, and Im worried that might be more frequent ... You try to live when the suns up. Tim Hooper, 50, Norfolk CB: Prepay meters make it more expensive, but its the worst-off people who have to use them. And it affects other things, for instance if people have to drive to their jobs and fuel costs go up. Those are the people who feel it first. One of the themes that comes through, as well as hardship itself, is a sense that you have no control over your life. *** June: Biggest rail strikes for 30 years over pay and conditions Euston Station during one of the years rail strikes.

I try to eat half my dinner and save the other half for lunch the next day. I cant see a way out. Were told to put lots of jumpers on, but were not over-consuming, were just trying to heat our homes over the winter. Its disgraceful. What are Ofgem for if theyre just increasing the price cap? Im really worried about my future. Lindsey Parker, 43, occupational therapist, Brighton Im a working single mother of four. In April, my monthly bill shot up from PS100 to PS167. Thats already PS802 more a year ... I will cancel my direct debit. Id rather be in the scary position of not paying my bill than being unable to buy food and other necessities this winter. Kayleigh, hotel housekeeper, Milton Keynes *** September: Liz Truss announces energy support package, but Kwasi Kwartengs budget sends mortgage rates spiralling Whilst Im very pleased that a lower cap has been introduced, the reality is those on universal credit will be paying twice as much for energy than they did last year ... I have turned off my hot water, unplugged everything Im not actively using, completely revised how I cook to economise. The ends just dont meet any more. Tim Hooper, 50, unemployed, Norfolk Im really worried about it. Conservative policies probably protect people like me. I wouldnt vote for them but this has turned into a major pitfall. Will I have to sell? Will I be able to sell, or do I cough up and try and weather the storm? I feel this is the first time the middle classes are going to be pushed on this. This is a bit of a wake-up call. Henry Langford, 31, London CB: When it started to hit mortgages in this major way, people were stunned. We heard from so many of them. One woman whod been saving with her husband for 16 years told us shed been completely blown out of the water, or a firefighter who has to refix next year and just cant afford it.

No one but the highest earners can comfortably afford childcare, especially on top of the cost of living crisis.

It is a massive stretch - Im knackered. This really isnt how I was expecting my 40s to be. Jo Thompson, 44, NHS senior analyst and pizza delivery driver, Lincolnshire The support for bills is not good enough, and the windfall tax on energy companies is pitiful given their massive profits ... The below-inflation pay rises in the civil service have meant for me that things have got more expensive ... Central government civil servants are often forgotten about, [whereas] nurses and teachers make the news. They certainly deserve better pay, but so do we. David, 30, civil servant, Sheffield CB: I dont think people believe that this is just all beyond the governments control because of Ukraine and the global situation. What we heard from people of every background was: they have stuffed us. There is a huge amount of anger. *** December: cold weather plus Christmas costs tip many people over the edge To keep myself warm I wear my pyjamas, dressing gown and coat, with gloves and hat if it gets too cold.

Theres black mould in near enough every room. I go around cleaning it off and it just comes back again. Clifford, 48, Glasgow CB: One cafe owner whose business has been devastated told me: I really hope seeing more and more people struggle might actually make the government do something for once.

Im currently going through the process of getting my house ready to rent out which I will be doing through an agent given the distance and time difference. However, Im a bit puzzled by the tax side of things and was hoping you could help. Ive been told by one agent that I will be liable to pay tax as a non-resident landlord, whereas other agents have said this is not the case. Ive looked online (including through the governments own advice) and I still dont feel Im sure. Please could you advise me on the state of things around tax and any other advice you think I should have before renting for the first time?JS A I hope youre going to use the first agent you spoke to as she is clearly more on the ball than those who told you that you wouldnt be liable to pay tax as a non-resident landlord. They have clearly missed the part of their training telling them about the non-resident landlord scheme (NRLS). Under UK law, this obliges UK lettings agents to withhold basic-rate tax due on rental income before it is paid to a UK landlord who lives overseas. You are considered a non-resident landlord - and so come under the NRLS - if you live outside the UK for more than six months. If there is no letting agent, the tenant has to withhold the tax, and pay it to HM Revenue and Customs if the rent is more than PS100 a week. If you dont want the letting agent to deduct tax from the rent, you have to send in form NRL1 either online or by post. This is worth doing provided your tax affairs are up to date and you do not expect to be liable for UK tax on your UK-based income. Whether you have your rental income paid before or after tax, youll need to fill in a self-assessment tax return as you would if you were a landlord living in the UK. However the rent is paid, it makes sense to have it paid in sterling into a bank account in the UK to avoid currency conversion costs. You also need to make sure that your mortgage lender is happy for you to let your house and check whether your insurers need to make changes to your buildings and contents policies once you have a tenant.

Vodafone is the latest company to introduce a low-cost deal aimed at those claiming specific benefits, including universal credit, pension credit or personal independence payment (Pip). It is now the cheapest broadband offer on the market at PS12 a month. Pressure has been growing for telecoms providers to do more to support customers during the cost of living crisis by introducing flexible social tariffs. These are broadband and mobile deals that, says Ernest Doku of the price comparison site Uswitch, are cheaper than the equivalent standard monthly rates, which means even more customers receiving universal credit and other benefits can access essential broadband services for less. It is now easier to apply for the deals, too. Since August, a system introduced by the Department for Work and Pensions means providers should be able to confirm which customers can access social tariffs, removing the need for them to prove their own eligibility each month, Doku says. The consumer group Which? warns that many customers are facing unaffordable bills this winter The UK telecoms regulator, Ofcom, has been calling for more companies to offer social tariffs, which can save the average household almost PS200 a year. However, they have been underpromoted, with only about 120,000 of the more than 4 million people eligible taking advantage of them. This all comes as the consumer group Which? warns that many customers are facing unaffordable bills this winter. Broadband companies are expected to put their prices up, mid-contract, in 2023 by as much as 14%, which works out as an average of about PS113 extra on top of the price you agree when you sign a one- to two-year deal, according to Which?. A customer on a two-year contract could end up paying PS156 more on their bills than they originally signed up for by the time the next round of price changes happen in 2024. The government has asked all broadband companies to offer and promote social tariffs but they are under no obligation to do so. As a result, there are about 10 that do, including Sky, BT, Virgin Media and Hyperoptic, with a selection of about 13 tariffs ranging from PS12 a month to PS25 a month - an average of PS16 less than their normal packages, although with varying internet speeds. Ofcom has been calling for more telecoms companies to offer social tariffs. Photograph: Rui VieiraPA Vodafones new Essentials Broadband social tariff promises download speeds of up to 38Mbps. Hyperoptics PS15-a-month Fair Fibre Plan offers up to 50Mbps, while for its PS25-a-month tariff it is up to 150Mbps. Vodafone charges no fee to set up the service, and the company says customers will not be subject to any mid-contract price rises during the 12 months the tariff lasts. Eligibility for a social tariff varies from company to company, although all are available to customers on universal credit. Vodafone, Hyperoptic, KCOM and Community Fibre, which operates in London, are some of the only companies to offer social broadband tariffs to those on Pip. Sky and Nows PS20-a-month Broadband Basics is one of those available to people claiming pension credit, while others include attendance allowance and care leavers support in their list. But some, such as Virgin Media, which has the second-cheapest deal on the market at PS12.50 a month for its Essential broadband, are restricted to only those on universal credit. There appears to be only one brand offering a social tariff for mobile phone customers: VOXI, which operates on the Vodafone network. Its For Now tariff gives unlimited data, calls and texts for PS10 a month - a deal that usually costs PS35 a month - to those claiming universal credit, jobseekers allowance, employment and support allowance, disability living allowance or Pip. The VOXI tariff lasts for six months, after which time you will be switched over to a PS10-a-month plan, which includes unlimited social media, calls and texts. There are many competitively priced deals out there at the moment Uswitchs Ernest Doku However, one big criticism of social tariffs is that some customers could face steep exit penalties coming out of their existing, more expensive, deals if they switch. If you are with a broadband provider that does offer a social tariff, you should be able to swap your deal midway through, penalty-free. However, if you are with a company that does not yet offer a social tariff, including TalkTalk, Shell, EE, Plusnet, O2 and Three, then you may face having to pay so much to terminate early that it reduces, or cancels out, the benefit. If you are not eligible for a social tariff, you can still save by shopping around for a cheaper deal as soon as your existing one ends. Doku says: There are many competitively priced deals out there at the moment, such as Hyperoptics 30Mbps fibre broadband for PS15 a month, which is the same price as its 50Mbps social tariff, or Now Broadband offering 11Mbps speeds for PS18 a month. Matthew Upton, the director of policy at Citizens Advice, says if you are struggling to afford your internet or phone bill, always contact your provider. You may be able to negotiate. Explain your situation to see if they can offer you a better deal.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/nov\/25\/uk-government-to-introduce-grants-to-make-homes-more-energy-efficient","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/nov\/25\/uk-government-to-introduce-grants-to-make-homes-more-energy-efficient","DATE":"2022-11-25 13:20:41","PLAIN_TEXT":"The business secretary, Grant Shapps, will announce a plan next week to offer grants of up to PS15,000 to middle-income households to make homes more energy efficient, according to reports. The scheme, called eco plus, will run from April and target middle-earners to enable them to fund work on their homes such as installing cavity-wall insulation or smart heating controls. The government has set aside PS1bn for the initiative that will target people in council tax bands A to D, according to the Times. The intention is to target 70,000 homes over three years, covering 75% of the cost of any energy efficiency upgrades to peoples homes. The push to encourage people to install upgrades in their homes is intended to drive significant cost savings at a time when oil and gas prices have surged as a result of Russias invasion of Ukraine. The UKs housing stock is the oldest and the least energy efficient in Europe, and the government has been forced to intervene in the market to shield people from skyrocketing energy bills. Installing loft insulation costs between PS455 and PS640, depending on the type of property, and can save a household between PS330 and PS590 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST). Cavity-wall insulation costs between PS580 and PS1,800, and can save between PS235 and PS690 a year. The funding will be administered by energy suppliers, unlike the green homes grant scheme that was axed last year and which offered PS5,000 or PS10,000 to install insulation or low-carbon heating. The scheme is part of a wider ambition that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced in the autumn statement to reduce energy consumption from buildings and industry by 15% by 2030. Reducing demand by this much means, in todays prices, a PS28bn saving from our national energy bill or PS450 off the average household bill, he said. The government is expected to approve a PS25m social media and advertising campaign before Christmas on how households can cut their winter energy usage. The advice will include a number of tips, such as turning off radiators in empty rooms, reducing the temperature of the boiler and taking showers rather than baths. The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, said the advice would not be nannying but would point people towards authoritative sources of advice on managing energy usage. A previous attempt to introduce a public information campaign on energy-saving measures was reportedly blocked by Liz Trusss administration.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2023\/jan\/15\/the-guardian-view-on-energy-prepayment-meters-customers-need-protecting","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/jan\/15\/the-guardian-view-on-energy-prepayment-meters-customers-need-protecting","DATE":"2023-01-15 18:25:20","PLAIN_TEXT":"The fact that 3.2 million people in Britain were left in the cold and dark last year after their energy prepayment meters ran out of credit shows that something has gone seriously wrong. The more information that emerges about the use of these meters, the more reasons for concern there seem to be. By shining a light on energy companies practices, and particularly what looks like a slapdash approach to consent, campaigners have succeeded in creating a sense of urgency. On Friday, Labours Ed Miliband called for an immediate to halt to forced installations. Ministers have also voiced concerns, but the question is how quickly and effectively action will be taken. Citizens Advice says that more people sought help with energy last year than in the past 10 years combined, with standing charges for meters another cost imposed on those who can least afford them. The rate of switching from other payment methods rose from 380,000 in 2021 to 600,000 in 2022. Faced by growing numbers of people priced out of energy use, suppliers have decided to get tough. Needless to say, many of those affected are also struggling with food prices and the chronic insecurity of privately rented housing. Ofgem, the energy regulator, has already issued warnings. Last year it criticised the service offered by suppliers to vulnerable customers and described variations in the quality of service as a case of pot luck. Faced by the prospect of millions more people being left without heat and light in coming months, it and the government must now insist on change and oversee it. Prepayment meters work for some customers, and the newer smart meters have features that the old ones do not - for example, enabling suppliers to add credit remotely. But the scale of compulsory switching is out of hand and should have been interrupted sooner. Rightly, the role of magistrates in signing off forced entry to properties is under scrutiny, after an investigation discovered that one court in the north of England issued almost 500 utility warrants in under four minutes. Some suppliers have already taken steps to ease the pressure on customers, by pausing debt collection over the winter. The impatience of others is the crux of the problem. The determination to avoid and recoup arrears drives the policy of insisting on prepayment. But when the weather is cold, prices are high, and companies have no reliable means of knowing which of their customers are vulnerable - for example, because they are disabled, require electricity to power medical equipment, or have a baby in the household - they must not be allowed to continue in the same vein. The proposed moratorium on forced installation called for by campaigners should be taken up. The judiciary should issue new guidance to ensure that warrants are not waved through in bulk. Energy is a necessity, not a luxury, and the fact that it is being withdrawn from people so frequently is an indication of both policy and market failure. When it comes to debt, policymakers as well as suppliers must develop alternatives to automatically applied clawbacks, which increase the bills of the poorest people. Some suppliers have behaved badly. The sector must be more proactive with regard to its vulnerable customers, instead of expecting them to request special treatment. But the fact that courts have authorised companies to force their way into hundreds of thousands of homes points to a wider political and regulatory failure. MPs must get a grip and stand up for their constituents.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/feb\/14\/home-worker-britain-see-saving-hit-higher-energy-internet-access-bills-ons-survey","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/feb\/14\/home-worker-britain-see-saving-hit-higher-energy-internet-access-bills-ons-survey","DATE":"2022-02-14 17:56:55","PLAIN_TEXT":"People with children and renters are more likely to have seen their spending on utility bills increase while working from home during the coronavirus pandemic, official figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said almost half of people who worked from home had spent less than they would have normally, with reduced costs for travel and food offset by an increase in spending on gas, electricity and internet access. However, it said the change in spending patterns was more pronounced for some people in the survey of more than 3,000 adults in Great Britain undertaken by government statisticians last month. As many as 92% of people working from home who live in rented accommodation reported increased spending on utilities, compared with 86% for home workers who were paying a mortgage and 77% for those who owned their homes outright. It also found people working from home with children were more likely to report increased spending on food, utilities and internet access compared with home workers without children. Related: UK cost of living crisis: the squeeze is on - heres what you can do Concerns are mounting over rising energy prices amid Britains cost of living crisis, with households expected to see a 54% increase in average gas and electricity bills from April. The government has announced plans to cushion the blow from rising prices, though charities have warned that millions of families will still be pushed into fuel poverty. The ONS said overall rates of home working rose during December and January as more people stayed indoors due to the Omicron variant. However, rates remained significantly lower than earlier in the pandemic. From 29% in September - the lowest since the pandemic began - the proportion of working adults who said they had worked from home at least once in the previous seven days rose to 36% in January. Home working rates peaked at 49% in early June 2020. Despite higher utility costs, almost half (46%) of people said they had spent less money as a result of working from home in January - a proportion similar to the ONS survey in November (49%). Half said they had spent less on fuel and parking for commuting, while 40% said they had spent less on public transport. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The ONS said the percentage of people working from home correlated with the stringency of Covid-19 restrictions and consumer spending, suggesting a link between working from home and reduced spending in shops, pubs and restaurants. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said people working from home could be in for a nasty shock when they go back to the office because of rising petrol and diesel prices and living costs.

Despite the efforts of many employers and government officials to bring people back into the physical workplace, the last thing many employees who are at home want to do is start commuting again. What is surprising, though, is just how much some workers are willing to surrender to their employers in order to keep the remote work arrangement going. A recent GoodHire study found that 61% of survey respondents would be willing to take a pay cut to maintain remote working status. Seventy percent of those surveyed also said that they would forfeit benefits like health insurance, paid time off and retirement accounts in order to keep working remotely. And this isnt purely hypothetical. The risk of having to make that tough choice is very real, with companies like Google already threatening to cut workers pay by up to 25% should they choose to work from home permanently. Still, its not hard to see why some workers would be so desperate to keep working from home that they would consider an up to 50% pay cut in some cases. Aside from reducing the risk of being exposed to Covid-19, remote work gives employees far more flexibility during their work day, a fact that has proven to have no bearing on their productivity. In fact, research has found that productivity is often higher when employees are permitted to work from home. Parents also save a ton of money on before- and after-school childcare, and can free themselves of sometimes long and grueling commutes. For Black women, staying at home has meant a reprieve from some of the microaggressions that they would typically face in an in-person work environment. Other workers of color have also found it a welcome relief to not have to code-switch or keep up a performance of white-centric professionalism. Aside from the fact that remote work simply makes workers lives easier, it seems like its just a more sensible alternative for most employers. Companies save serious money in overhead like office space and other administrative costs. And aside from being able to physically monitor their workers during work hours, is there any real reason why bosses have to hover over their employees day in and day out? Thankfully, many workers are seeing this bigger picture, and choosing to do whats best for them. According to the GoodHire study, 45% of Americans would either quit their job or immediately start a remote-work job-search if they were forced to return to their office full-time. And its already happening. Nearly 4 million Americans quit their jobs this past July, part of what some economists are calling the Great Resignation. For some workers, this mass exodus was brought on by the fact that the pandemic caused them to rethink their priorities, perhaps focusing on finding their dream job as opposed to the one that simply pays the bills. But for many others, the decision to leave came specifically because they were asked to come back into the office. This is exactly the kind of defiant thinking that should be applied if workers are forced to decide between coming into the office and taking a pay cut. While I wouldnt advocate quitting your job in these precarious times, employees should absolutely not take any kind of pay reduction or changes to their benefits package in order to be able to work from home. From needing to have reliable internet connection, to providing your own supplies, to organizing and cleaning your own workplace, there is a lot that is required of a person who is working remotely. And with women still responsible for the vast majority of unpaid domestic work worldwide, working from home has meant that they are doing even more parenting alongside work-related duties under the same roof. In one pandemic study, 80% of mothers who were spending more time at home with their kids reported that they are experiencing more stress during the pandemic, with 72% reporting increased anxiety. More than half reported that they are experiencing more frustrations with their kids. With this in mind, the obvious question is: why should women have to pay to do double the amount of work? Working from home has made life easier for a lot of people. But easier or more convenient working conditions shouldnt come at a cost to workers; they should simply be a part of good corporate practice.

The shift to working from home and concerns about the cost of living continue to hold back trade, with visits to shopping centres down by more than a quarter on 2019 while high streets had 14% fewer visitors. Scotland, Wales, north-east England and London fared far worse than the east Midlands and north-west England, according to the latest British Retail Consortium (BRC) footfall monitor conducted in partnership with shopper monitoring operator Sensormatic Solutions. The declines marked a slight improvement on Aprils numbers, with high streets seeing a particularly strong recovery. Visitor numbers were also strongly up on last year - by an average 19% across all types of destination - as warm sunny weather and the prospect of the forthcoming jubilee celebrations helped to boost sales. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, which represents most big retailers in the UK, said: UK footfall made small advances for a third month in a row, as the particularly warm May weather saw more people shop in person. The anticipation for the jubilee celebrations offered an added boost to footfall, with the public hitting the shops to find the best decorations and festive food and drink for the long weekend. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk She added: Improvement to footfall remains fragile as the cost of living bites. With UK discretionary incomes falling, governments financial support to tackle surging energy costs may only provide temporary respite for households. As inflation continues to climb and consumer confidence falls, it is by no means certain footfall will continue to improve in the months to come. Andy Sumpter, at Sensormatic Solutions, said that UK high streets were recovering more strongly than other G7 countries with footfall in Germany and Italy both down by about 20% in May and France by nearly 22%. However, Sumpter cautioned: With households already starting to feel the pinch of the rising cost-of-living and growing inflationary pressures, retailers will be hoping that cracks dont start to appear in the footfall recovery. As they look ahead to June, retailers will be hoping that high streets will be rallied by the jubilee weekend celebrations and that the event will prompt ambient shopper traffic and retail spend.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2023\/mar\/14\/why-is-it-only-women-who-have-to-juggle-jobs-and-childcare","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2023\/mar\/14\/why-is-it-only-women-who-have-to-juggle-jobs-and-childcare","DATE":"2023-03-14 17:42:20","PLAIN_TEXT":"Instead of women doing the juggling yet again (I did standup with my baby strapped to me - the comics motherhood cant stop, 14 March), when will we see a story headlined The men who juggle comedy gigs with childcare?

Over the past five years or so her responsibilities have grown and her staff team has shrunk to a point where it is clearly impossible for her to do the work required. She works ridiculous hours in an attempt to achieve the impossible - which she cant, which makes her miserable, stressed and bad-tempered. I love her deeply and I hate to see her so unhappy, but life with someone who alternates between snappy and tearful is awful, and her absolute refusal to do anything - flag the situation shes in, see a doctor, anything - to improve things is deeply frustrating. I did manage to persuade her to join the union but she will not ask them for any sort of help. Home life is intolerable for me and must be much worse for her. Should I do anything? What can I do? Eleanor says: Sometimes when your partner goes through a trying period, your job is to help as much as possible - including by being forgiving. Other times the fact that things are just busy right now is no longer something thats foisted on them - its a situation theyve chosen to remain in. Past that point, the fact that the birthday party got missed or the plans got changed last-minute stops being something we can talk about in the passive voice. Their busy-ness stops being something thats happening to them - it starts being something theyre doing. The trouble is its very hard to figure out where that point is. Its going to be different for different families; informed by what youve agreed on, your finances, who does the domestic work, how well expectations are managed, and what viable alternatives there are. But even though everyone has a different point of busy-toleration, you need to be able to tell your partner when youve gone past yours. It sounds like youre well past yours. Related: I saw a message saying Morning Sweetpea xx on my partners phone. Should I get past this? | Leading questions Id start by making absolutely sure youve communicated that. Although your letter suggests youve talked about this together, youd be surprised by how wide a knowledge asymmetry can sneak into a marriage. What you experience as an ever-present problem - the thing you bring up repeatedly, your highest priority for fixing - she may experience very differently. If someone asked her today how happy you are at home, what would she say? If youre anything less than confident that shed name the same problems you have written here, Id start with a clear and careful conversation to fix that. These chats can be tricky, but youre not accusing her of ruining your home life - your letter brims with regard and genuine concern. All you need to communicate is that concern plus one additional insight: theres no reason to suppose work will get better by itself. Second, Im curious what shape her refusal to do anything takes. Where you invest your energy depends on which one of these scenarios she is in. Is it that overwork has eroded her mental health? Terrible workplaces make casualties of our self-esteem and imagination, two things we need lots of to chase a better future. Or is it a point of pride to work so hard; is she proving something to a colleague, or to herself? Is there a feature of the rest of life that working so hard allows her to evade? Working with her to discover why she doesnt want help may make it feel less invasive to try to supply it. Try not to lead with how this affects you - start with how it impacts her and the we of your collective life. That way youre on her side. Meantime, it might help to start small - suggesting a phoneless walk in the morning together, or a dedicated hour once a week with no work-chat allowed; some time set aside on the weekend to take turns doing nice things for one another.

Some City law practices have moved beyond office-based working and made the shift to fully flexible and remote models. If there was ever a time to gain qualifications remotely, nows the moment to do it. At The University of Law (ULaw), legal and business courses can be part-time or full-time and are available to start throughout the year. With its virtual learning platform, you get 247 access to course materials, you can set your own deadlines and there are live sessions as well as pre-recorded lectures at its dedicated campus ULaw Online. For Victoria Birch, the idea of being fully in control of her studies was the deciding factor. My mum was a lawyer and its always been nagging at the back of my head, but it wasnt until I realised I was able to do the PGDL at ULaw fully at my own pace that I finally committed. Its given me the opportunity to go in the direction Ive always wanted to go in. Many people want to stay at home to save commuting time and costs, so office workers are now much more communicative about what works for them. At ULaw there is always help on hand for those studying from home. Whether youre full-time or part-time, expert tutors are available to help prepare you for topics, improve your knowledge and consolidate your understanding. You will also have a designated personal tutor to support you throughout your studies. In terms of wellbeing and emotional support, there are a wide range of services available that all students can access over the phone or via Microsoft Teams. If you have money problems, mental health issues or feel you may need to be referred to the counselling service, it is easier than ever and can be anonymous if preferred. Students can make contact with the digital mental health service via WhatsApp, live chat or by requesting a call back. There is also peer support available, self-help programmes and a specially designed app, BeWell, that focuses on wellbeing and mindfulness techniques. Although its not always easy to network or make friends on a video call, ULaw works hard to put students in front of the right people at the right time. Students have the chance to work with business professionals and get dedicated one-to-one mentorship from some of ULaws highly experienced and professional alumni working at leading brands such as Google, Channel 4 and Aviva. A previous mentee, legal practice course (LPC) student Will Headlam-Wells, described the experience as priceless. Matched with Channel 4 lawyer Amelia Wilson, he says having a mentor gave him invaluable insight from a practising solicitor in his area of interest, which helped him on the way to qualifying. She helped me fine-tune my career planning, introduced me to people, identified areas for improvement and gave me encouragement and confidence to achieve these goals. The university offers a full range of support services online, from mental health to mentoring. Photograph: Massimo ColomboGetty Images Alumna Bethany Thompson, who studied the combined LPC and masters in law and business management, had a similar experience. After struggling to get past the application stage of interviews, Thompson joined the ULaw mentoring scheme. She says it definitely boosted her chances. I had been struggling for three years to get a foot in the door at an assessment centre, let alone coming close to securing a vacation scheme or training contract. I felt frustrated that I had a first-class law degree at a good university and various legal work experience and volunteering but kept falling at the application process stage. Related: How a university equips its grads with the skills to land top jobs She found firms were too busy to provide feedback on how she could improve for future applications, which left her feeling stuck in a revolving door of rejections without knowing where she was going wrong. Signing up to the mentoring scheme changed this and she got the feedback and support she needed. Now an associate solicitor herself, she says the scheme was invaluable in helping her reach her goal. I also ended up meeting someone that I get on with in both a personal and professional capacity. Not only is studying online at ULaw a convenient way of gaining the qualifications needed to be a lawyer or work in the City, its an opportunity to get the most out of your studies without the unnecessary distractions of commuting. You can still make connections and get support, but studying is on your terms at times that suit you. Birch says she hasnt looked back. Im really, really pleased.

The carved legs have been painted black but the top has the appearance of dark marble flecked with orange. Im really pleased with that table, says Sloan. I took a sponge, cut some more holes in it and used it to apply paint. Its funny - sometimes I spend ages trying to make something work and it looks just awful. And then something takes me 10 minutes and its like, Oh wow! Sloan, 73, has been experimenting with paint and colour for over 50 years and shows no signs of slowing down. When I left art school, I realised conceptual work didnt actually make me happy, she says. It was colour that people seemed to need most in their lives. Half a century on, in this age of greige and permacrises, we arguably need colour more than ever. Riad Terracotta was used for the hallway. Photograph: Rachael SmithThe Guardian Unsurprisingly, Sloans own home - a four-bedroom, late-Victorian terrace in Oxford, which she shares with her husband, David Manuel - is a masterclass in how to use it. From piano to splashback, there is barely an unpainted surface in the house. The entrance hall is in a sun-baked orange called Riad Terracotta, and the floorboards in Antibes Green. Like all the paints in the house, both are from her own Annie Sloan collection. You can get away with huge amounts of craziness in the hallway, she says, because its not an area you spend much time in. The kitchen splashback has been painted with bright, dynamic shapes that contrast with gun-metal painted cabinets From here, several green steps descend to a mezzanine garden room. Here, the walls range from orange to green to pink, the latter inspired by the interiors of a Cuban cafe. The pink has been waxed, Sloan says, a product Ive developed to protect our paints. It gives the walls this beautiful mellow finish. Down another half level is a basement kitchen and dining room. The kitchen has been extended to incorporate a dank, underused corner of the garden, now a bright breakfast room edged with wooden planters adorned with architectural salvage - fragments of chairs and mouldings that have just been stuck on and painted. The same creative approach applies to the kitchen splashback, which has been painted with bright, joyous figures that contrast with gun-metal painted cabinets. In the adjoining dining room, a hand-painted piano stands against bright red waxed walls which have the lustre of Chinese lacquer. Annie Sloan surrounded by finds from her travels. Photograph: Rachael SmithThe Guardian On the ground floor, two separate living rooms have been knocked together. At one end, ornate plasterwork stands out against grass-green walls (Schinkel Green, named after neoclassical German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel). I knew that I wanted something strong and bright in here, says Sloan. It had to be a colour that could carry the strong artwork we have. If you put those colours on anything too neutral, they just sort of die, so it had to be bright but not hot. In the alcoves either side of the fireplace, shelves have been painted in an array of colours that make the objects sing. At the opposite end of the room, the walls are a more subdued warm grey (French Linen), chosen to reflect the quieter art and objects in this part of the room. (Although she couldnt resist a sunset streak of Barcelona orange above the picture rail.) The kitchen splashback was painted with bright joyous figures. Photograph: Rachael SmithThe Guardian After a degree in fine art, Sloan segued into interiors and began working for private clients. It was in the days of marbling and wood graining, so I did all of that and ended up writing a book about it, she says. The Complete Book of Decorative Paint Techniques was published in 1987 and sold over two million copies, establishing Sloan as an authority on colour. Three years later, as shabby-chic and upcycling were emerging as interiors trends, Sloan launched her own paint company, producing colours designed to transform vintage furniture. I ended up working with a factory in Belgium that was willing to experiment with me, she says. Together, they established a formula for her Chalk Paint range, which can be used on just about any surface without preparation. The master bedroom is painted Aubusson Blue.

When she was 10 the family moved to Kent. Sloan recalls spending six weeks aboard a ship that travelled to the UK via Fiji, Tahiti and Panama. The experience instilled in her a lifelong love of travel, and her home is filled with objects sourced from her globe-trotting: a saints head from Brazil, maquettes from China, ceramics from South Africa, a collection of jugs from the south of France - just things I really like the shape or colour of. Throughout the house, one-off finds jostle for space, and picture frames hang slightly askew. Things do move around quite a lot, admits Sloan. People tend to think that the house is done now, that Im not going to do anything else. But I think its a good idea to keep our homes in flux.

Home-based work, while neither possible nor desirable for some, is a popular, family-friendly working practice that has widespread social, economic and environmental benefits.

His wife, tapir conservationist Patricia Medici, came upon a giant armadillo one night in 2009 while working in the field. Hearing the story lit a fire in Desbiez. This was my dream species, the holy grail of all mammals, he says. I said, You know what? If I could just see it. Weighing up to 50kg and growing up to 1.5 metres in length, the giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) is bigger than most large dogs, with a 15cm sickle claw used to plunder rock-hard termite mounds. Yet it was one of the least understood - and least recorded - animals. With a very low demographic density and shy night-time behaviour, the giant armadillo was mostly a ghost of South America - until Desbiez set to work. Isabelle the giant armadillo captured by a remote camera. Photograph: ICAS Desbiezs first step was to install remote camera traps. A few months later, I got my first image of a giant armadillo. That picture completely changed my life, he says. Since then, he has been cracking the mysteries of the animal, upending previous notions about its breeding, parenting and ecological importance, and finding ways to protect the giant from extinction. He calls this the giant armadillo adventure, because what started with three guys working in the Pantanal has expanded to an NGO [the Giant Armadillo Conservation Project] with 22 people. As well as the 350 sq km study area in the Pantanal - the largest wetlands in the world - the project has moved into two other locations in Brazil, the Cerrado, a tropical grassland, and the Atlantic Forest, a coastal rainforest. It has also established education programmes, community fire brigades within the mammals habitat and giant armadillo-friendly honey. No giant armadillo has taught Desbiez more than an adult female named Isabelle. Desbiez started tracking her in 2011. Her first pup was killed by a male looking to mate with her. Her second pup, Alex, lived with Isabelle for two years until he died after being attacked by a puma. Arnaud Desbiez checks the remote camera to see what images it has captured during the night. Photograph: ICAS Isabelles behaviour helped clear up some of the misperceptions about the animals, which Desbiez says were mostly anecdotal. Researchers thought giant armadillos probably had two young with each pregnancy - Desbiez discovered they only had one. It was also thought pups spent six months with their mother, but Desbiez learned that pups dont leave their mothers home range until they are three or four years old. Thats a really long time. What does this show us? That every giant armadillo is absolutely precious, that any threat to the species - deforestation, hunting, disease, fire - has a huge impact and can cause local extinction, says Desbiez. Desbiez has also studied how long it takes for giant armadillos to mature and produce their own pups. The giant armadillos teeth lack enamel and their nails wear differently depending on the season, making it impossible to detect age using either of these methods. So Desbiez turned to another potential measuring method: the male armadillos penis. For their body size, armadillos have one of the largest penises, Desbiez says - a mature males can measure 35cm. He says the species has probably evolved such a long penis because of the practicalities of coupling with a rotund, heavily armoured female. Arnaud Desbiez and Gabriel Massocato measuring a giant armadillo. Photograph: Lorne GillICAS Desbiez and his team were able to determine that the giant armadillo doesnt reach sexual maturity until seven to nine years of age. The generation time of the species is not seven years, as currently noted on the IUCN red list, but closer to 11 years, though that may be an underestimate, he says. A longer generation time means giant armadillos are more vulnerable to extinction than was thought, especially in small, local areas. For example, Desbiez says the team has discovered there is only one viable population of giant armadillos in the heavily fragmented Atlantic Forest (only about 10% of which remains). Alex, aged five months, with his mother, Isabelle. Photograph: ICAS The giant armadillo will take three to four years to produce one pup. [Whereas] in three years a nine-banded armadillo will have 12 pups, a giant armadillo will have one, says Desbiez. The giant armadillo was last assessed for the IUCN red list in 2013, when it was listed as vulnerable to extinction, but Desbiezs work will help inform the next update. In the Pantanal study area, Desbiez and his team have captured and studied 36 live giant armadillos in the past 13 years, and recorded two dozen more. But Isabelle remains one of his favourites. Given that she was producing pups in 2012, Desbiez estimates she is at least 20 years old. But she could be 30. She is gorgeous and looks fantastic, he says. How long giant armadillos live in the wild is still down to estimates, though Desbiez says they are clearly slow-maturing, long-living mammals, which makes them more vulnerable to extinction threats. The key to saving the giant armadillo is working with people, says Desbiez. Its really about communicating, articulating, and really ... getting everybody to work together and applying all these things, he says. I think ... there should be classes just about communication, facilitation, and these kinds of skills [for conservation students]. Desbiez and his team raised funds for better equipment to tackle the increasing number of wildfires. Photograph: Direitos Reservados In 2019 and 2020, devastating fires whipped through the Pantanal, including the giant armadillo study site. During the 2019 fire, Desbiez remembers a local landowner on her tractor ploughing all night in an attempt to put out the flames, while her ranch hands were firefighting in sandals and shorts, armed only with branches. The following year, while watching television, Desbiez saw army fire brigades with all this great firefighting equipment. This is a species that few people have ever seen ... yet it plays a central role in the ecosystem If we had this equipment, we could also combat fires, says Desbiez. So his team went to donors and asked for help. With the funds they raised, they bought firefighting equipment and trained ranchers in how to safely combat blazes, which are expected to become more extreme with climate breakdown. Desbiez says his team has recorded three giant armadillos killed by fire - in 2013, 2017 and 2019 - but the Giant Armadillo Conservation Project has since trained and given firefighting equipment to 15 ranchers in the Pantanal study area in the hope armadillos will not succumb in the future. In the Cerrado - where giant armadillos survive in only a few fragments of habitat - human-wildlife conflict with the beekeeping community has also posed a threat to their existence. Giant armadillos will knock down beehives to access and prey on the larvae, which can lead to revenge killings by beekeepers. A beekeeper inspects armadillo damage to his hive. The Giant Armadillo Conservation Project is working towards better relations with the beekeeping community. Photograph: Guto Akasaki The Giant Armadillo Conservation Project works directly with beekeepers to produce giant armadillo-friendly honey. The farmers agree to not hurt or kill armadillos and in return they get help protecting their beehives, such as with electric fences. The animal-friendly label also means their honey can be sold at a premium. Related: Pink dolphins and reformed Colombian rebels turn no-go zone into ecotourism hit Desbiez says they have certified more than 100 beekeepers to date - but that this is less of an incentive for smaller producers who usually sell informally at markets. For them, says Desbiez, the NGO will supply up to three queen bees. We dont give any money, but we want beekeepers to get a benefit from giant armadillo presence so that people want to coexist with them. Its a positive thing to coexist, he says. In protecting armadillos, Desbiez and his team are also helping myriad other species. Giant armadillos dig out large dens, which animals such as ocelots and tortoises make use of. Other animals, including tapirs and pumas, will use the large dust and dirt mound left behind for cooling off.

Take in a lodger Soaring household bills are making it tougher than ever to make ends meet. However, your home could provide some extra income, and you might not even have to pay tax on this cash. The UK governments rent-a-room scheme enables you to earn up to PS7,500 a year completely tax free through letting out a furnished room in your home. You can advertise your room online on websites such as SpareRoom (where you can also download a lodger agreement for PS4.99). Another website, RoomBuddies, which some people will have used before, has now merged with SpareRoom. You must live in the property with the lodger at least some of the time to qualify for the allowance Just make sure to let your home insurance provider know that you have taken in a lodger. You must live in the property with the lodger at least some of the time to qualify for the allowance, and it must be your main residence. If you earn more from letting a room, you will need to complete a tax return to pay any tax due on the remaining income. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at the investment website Hargreaves Lansdown, says: You dont need to own the property to use the allowance but if youre renting, you need to check your tenancy agreement carefully, and if in doubt, talk to your landlord. In many cases subletting is specifically forbidden. 2. Rent out your parking space or driveway You can rent out your garage, off-street parking space or driveway on an hourly, weekly or monthly basis. There are several websites that link people with spare parking space with drivers who need to park in a particular place. You can advertise on websites such as YourParkingSpace, JustPark and Park On My Drive. ParkLet is an option for longer-term lets. Have you considered making money from a driveway? Photograph: Paul Springett 02Alamy You may pay a listing fee, and you will typically pay about 5% to 20% commission on bookings. If you live near a busy railway station or big attraction where parking is at a premium, you could make a chunk of cash. Similarly, if you live near an airport, you may want to offer a space for holidaymakers. The most popular football ground when it comes to local residents renting out their parking space is Manchester Uniteds Old Trafford, with average booking fees of PS13 when an event is on, according to YourParkingSpace. 3. Turn your home into a film set Every film and TV drama needs suitable set locations, and you dont need to live in a fancy property for your home to make money as a film location. Plenty of ordinary homes are used. However, if you live near or in London, and have plenty of parking for film crews, your home is more likely to be chosen. If you have got a series that you know is being filmed locally, you could be in luck. For example, the BBC drama Casualty has been running for decades, with Bristol residents making money from offering their homes as locations when production was based there, before moving to Cardiff. Short-term rentals for photo and film shoots are skyrocketing, as it pays better than Airbnb and is less disruptive Scoutys Ryan Gannon You can advertise your home on agency websites such as Scouty, Location Works, Amazing Space and Shootfactory. On average, hosts make from PS500 to PS2,000 a month from one to three bookings by renting out their home as a location, according to Scouty. The average shoot length is one day. Ryan Gannon, the co-founder of Scouty, says: Short-term rentals for photo and film shoots are skyrocketing, as it pays better than Airbnb and is less disruptive. The shoots that take place range from small individual content creators, like YouTubers, all the way to large film productions. Location Collective is on the hunt for architecturally inspiring properties within the M25 or home counties. Its properties have featured in popular BBC shows such as Killing Eve and Silent Witness. If you have a spacious family home, try Lavish Locations. 4. Rent out your storage space If you have a half-empty loft or garage, say, then consider renting this to someone who needs it to store their things. You can list your space on websites such as Storemates by detailing the location, size and monthly cost. According to the storage rental company Stashbee, you can expect to earn about PS1,000 a year on average from renting an unused garage or loft space. You could even turn an unused area of your home into a rentable storage space, such as a bedroom or large cupboard. 5. Hire your home as an office space The coronavirus pandemic changed the way we work, with more of us than ever now working from home for at least some of the time. But not everyone has the space to set up a home office. If you have a spare room, you could earn between PS50 and PS250 a day by renting it out to a home worker.

To sign up, you detail your space and include some photos and the price for a day. Hosts can earn from PS85 to PS450 a day renting their place to single photographers, for example, startups or bigger companies. 6. House swap Deciding to house swap isnt so much about making money but it could save you a fortune on holiday costs. After all, as living costs soar, it can be hard to justify spending a lot on breaks abroad. You could house swap with someone to have a holiday near the sea.

House swapping may also be a good way to explore somewhere new if you work from home, giving you a break from your home office. If you have kids and want to travel at peak periods, the savings can be particularly substantial. You could arrange an informal swap with family or a friend, or ask around to see if anyone is looking to do the same. Alternatively, there are several home swap websites where you can list your home and search for accommodation. You can register with Guardian Home Exchange, for example, and choose from three different plans to become a member.

Im talking about the commute, which for decades has been taken for granted as a necessary part of the workday but which recently has been proven to be completely unnecessary for a large swath of workers. The miserable trek down the freeway or the sweaty wait for a late bus is coming back in vogue now that companies from Apple to Amazon and Goldman Sachs to JPMorgan Chase have told their workers to come back to the office in larger numbers. They say they need to do this to foster innovation and increase productivity. As a CEO, that doesnt make any sense to me. Our credit card processing company, Gravity Payments, has worked remotely since the pandemic began. How was our productivity affected? This April, we set a record for revenue. In May, we broke that again. The extra revenue allowed us to grow past 200 employees for the first time, and remote work opened up our recruiting pool significantly: we now have workers in 24 states. Nationwide, research shows remote work has fueled a 5% increase in productivity, largely because people arent burnt out from commuting. What motivates you? The chance to have a pizza party at the office? Or knowing you can spend rush hour having dinner with your family instead of getting honked at by someone who just cut you off? The truth is, companies have had it too good for too long by requiring staff to spend unpaid time traveling to and from work just so managers can feel in control. Lets do some basic math to illustrate just how much of a raw deal commuting is for workers: The average worker spends 55.2 minutes commuting each day, up 10% from 2006. The typical worker makes $20.17 an hour. But add in the time commuting, and that pay rate drops to $18.09 an hour. Heres another way of thinking about it: if you actually got paid for the time you commute, the median worker would make an extra $4,800 a year. Add in the hefty cost of commuting and its not hard to see why so many workers are quitting jobs that are requiring them to trek back to the office. And the money is only half the story: research shows that workers feel more negative emotions during their morning commute than at any other point in the day. How does making people miserable before work unlock productivity? Whats the solution? Just ask employees what they want. Instead of making a top-down decision as a CEO, I asked our staff how they want to work. Just 7% wanted to go back to the office full time, while 31% wanted an office-remote hybrid and the remaining 62% wanted to work from home all the time. So I told them: sounds great. Do whatever you want. This stuff isnt hard. Employees know how to do their jobs better than any CEO ever could. The shift to remote work can be life-changing for employees. Like a lot of companies, our main office is located in a high-cost city. Here in Seattle, basic necessities can be a struggle even with our companys median salary close to $100,000. Now, employees have been able to keep their salary and move to more affordable areas, where they find it possible for the first time to afford a house and start a family. For employers, there are plenty of benefits to putting employees first. I keep reading headlines about companies being unable to find workers. But weve had more than 300 applicants per job opening this year. Weve always had a lot of applicants because of our $70,000 minimum wage, but nothing like the flood of interest weve seen since we made job openings remote-eligible. In the bigger picture, eliminating commutes is probably the single biggest thing any company can do to help the environment. Whenever I turn on my TV, I see ads from corporations claiming to be green. Then I open the newspaper and read how they require desk workers to spend an hour a day spewing exhaust into the atmosphere to reach an office park not accessible by public transit. I know companies already on the hook for millions of dollars in office leases want to use their space. But forcing all employees back to work is throwing good money after bad, and will create extra short-term costs (like turnover) and long-term costs (like low morale). There are plenty of businesses that really do need to operate in person, and specific roles that require face-to-face interaction. But people who have shown over the last year that they can do their job just as well or better at home deserve to choose how they want to work - and companies will be better off by getting out of the way and letting workers decide.

Catherine Mann, a member of the Banks monetary policy committee, said that virtual working methods, such as video conferencing, were unable to replicate spontaneous office conversations that are important to career advancement. Virtual platforms are way better than they were even five years ago, Mann said, speaking at an event for women in finance hosted by the newspaper Financial News. But the extemporaneous, spontaneity - those are hard to replicate in a virtual setting. Women arent returning to work to the same extent as men, and when they are working, they are more likely to be working from home. Issues include difficulty accessing childcare, and disruption to schooling because of the pandemic has led to more women continuing to work remotely. There is the potential for two tracks, she said. Theres the people who are on the virtual track and people who are on the physical track. And I do worry that we will see those two tracks develop, and we will pretty much know whos going to be on which track, unfortunately. Vincent Keaveny, the lord mayor of London, said that increasing numbers of City staff were returning to the office in the UKs financial centre. The City is coming back to life, he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme. It is a really important thing for younger members of the sector to get the training they need, the creativity, the collegiality that the office brings. Keaveny, a partner at the law firm DLA Piper, said companies should be left to set their own policies on staff returning to work and that there is not a one-size-fits-all post-pandemic model. I think every company is coming at this from different places, he said. I dont think we should be telling people, telling companies, we shouldnt be micromanaging companies on an approach to this issue. But there is a very strong message that the City is open. Wed love to see more people coming back.

Previous ONS research had found that women were more likely to work from home than men because it gave them more time to work with fewer distractions. In August, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, warned younger workers that they could put their careers at risk if they worked from home.

Im no better off than when I was on PS7,000 a year Jo Thompson, a single mother of two from Lincolnshire, usually works a 45-hour week as an NHS senior analyst and team leader by day, earning a salary of PS41,000. By night, she is a pizza delivery driver, a job she took on at the end of August. I now work around 60 hours per week, the 44-year-old says. I felt having a pizza delivery job was embarrassing initially, but Im grateful Ive got the opportunity to do something to improve my financial situation. I have two teenage children, and every month I ended up deep in overdraft. But when my boiler broke, my car broke down, my daughter needed a new mattress and her bicycle was stolen, I decided I had to give a second job a go. Jo Thompson works in the Lincolnshire NHS and has a second job for a local pizza delivery company. Photograph: Fabio de PaolaThe Guardian Thompson says the extra income helps reduce worries about her finances, but is still not enough. After paying her mortgage of PS599 and PS70 ground rent, utility bills amounting to PS374, PS240 for petrol, PS150 for her childrens travel to school, PS120 for life, home, car and dental cover insurance, her PS20 union fee, a PS35 contribution to charity and PS170 towards her credit card bill, she has PS527 left for food and everything else. Ill soon be earning PS43,000 in my main job, but this wont touch the sides. Another driver at the pizza place is quitting soon and Ill ask for their shifts, so Ill be doing around 75 hours per week. It is a massive stretch, Im knackered. My children are very understanding, but our lives now have to be organised with military precision. Im also the only child of an elderly parent, and have to take my mum shopping and to appointments. This really isnt how I was expecting my 40s to be. Its crazy. I thought Id be comfortable and able to provide adequately for my family, but, absurdly, Im no better off financially now than I was when I was earning PS7,000 a year and getting help with housing and other costs. I could not pay the mortgage without a second job Even people whose household incomes are significantly above average say they have no other option but to take on second jobs. Caleb*, 46, a divorced father of three children under 13, lives in Surrey and worked as a full-time project manager in financial services regulation when he decided he had to take on a second full-time gig in the same field about a year ago. I had to take on a second job to keep my head above water, when the cost of living began spiralling out of control, he says. Its very similar to what I do in my main job. Due to the fact that I can work from home, Ive been able to take on a second clients project, so I ping-pong between the two all day. Historically I used to work 40 hours a week. Now I work 80. Saving two hours of commuting time by working remotely does not protect him from having to work late into the night. My work now erodes all family and personal time. It depletes you. But because the going day rate for projects in my sector has been shrinking steadily since Brexit - as much of the work has moved to Europe - Id be in financial difficulty without my second job. I could not pay the mortgage. Juggling the two jobs simultaneously, Caleb says, cannot work in the long term. He is considering downsizing to a smaller property that is less of a financial burden. The two jobs are an interim measure so I can build up a financial buffer thatll allow me to work just one job again, and focus on my family. Im currently squirrelling away about PS500 a month. But when that buffer will have run out, after six months perhaps, Ill have to revert to taking on a second job again. I dont know what the way out is. Its very worrying, but needs must. I use what I make from my Saturday job to pay for unforeseen costs James Oldham, 34, from Shropshire, is supplementing his income with a weekend job. Photograph: James OldhamGuardian Community James Oldham, a horticultural buyer from Shropshire, works 50 hours a week at a busy plant nursery and has had to take on Saturday shifts of eight hours in a large private garden he helps re-landscape to support his family. Until we are entitled to claim government childcare support when our twin girls turn three our only option is for my wife to stay at home. If she went back to work her entire pay would go on nursery fees, Oldham, 34, says. My PS1,800 main income after tax just about covers our living costs, including mortgage, fuel, groceries, bills and council tax. I use the PS600 a month that I make from my Saturday job to pay for unforeseen costs, such as car repair. Without it, Id find myself having to put fuel on the credit card in some months, and we try to put some of it aside for a rainy day, although we dont manage to do that every month. Were the perfect example of what the average family with young kids has to do just to get by. I have to accept every additional shift Im offered Sarah, 58, a supervisor in a secondary school in Cornwall, works as a swimming coach and lifeguard on the side to make ends meet. The youngest of her seven children still lives at home, while some of the others occasionally stay for shorter periods of time. Last school year I was working 42 and a half hours a week during term time and then gave swimming lessons two evenings a week, Sarah says. I have since switched to the school my son attends, to see him occasionally, where I now work 32 and a half hours a week, then either teach swimming for a further two hours or do an evening shift as a lifeguard or receptionist. I have to accept every additional shift Im offered; some days Im working 13 hours. My childrens father hasnt paid a penny in child maintenance in five years, even though hes supposed to. I rent, and if I didnt have the second job Id have to apply for universal credit to get help with housing costs. The long work days have taken their toll on both her mental and physical health, Sarah says. I still cant afford to eat properly, which isnt helping. I cant afford to put much diesel in my van so cycle to work whenever possible, which helps with my mental health, but not with my fatigue. I sometimes feel that I cant cope, that I cant do it on my own. Im not going to be able to afford to retire. *This name has been changed","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/24\/you-be-the-judge-should-our-daughter-pay-more-towards-the-heating-bills","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/dec\/24\/you-be-the-judge-should-our-daughter-pay-more-towards-the-heating-bills","DATE":"2022-12-24 08:00:27","PLAIN_TEXT":"The prosecution: Lillian Abigail secretly turns the radiators on in the day, while were out. But were trying to keep costs down My daughter Abigail recently moved back home, with me and my husband, Rich. Although I love having her around, shes a bit demanding with the central heating. Were trying to keep costs down but shes constantly driving them up. Weve set the heating to come on at 6pm every day, when Rich and I arrive home from work. But she moans about it and says, Mum, its always freezing. This house is like a prison. Shes a graphic designer and works remotely from our house, and always wants it boiling hot, even in winter. Weve had some arguments. A few times shes had the heating on all day, only to turn it down again a couple of hours before we get home in the hope we wont notice. But we werent born yesterday; we can tell when we walk in and feel the temperature. Abigail can go to a coffee shop to work if she doesnt like the house rules, but she says Im evicting her Rich has sometimes come home early and found the radiators scalding hot. Abigails defence is shes working from home and needs the heating on, so she doesnt freeze. Ive told her to wait until January, when it gets really cold, then she can start whacking the heating on in the late afternoon. I also think Abigail could go into her office or to a coffee shop to work if she doesnt like the house rules, but she says Im evicting her. I now have a smart meter so I can see how much were spending on gas all day. If Abigail is at home with the heating on and using the oven to heat up her tiny lunches, I can track that. It sounds a bit anal, but I had to get it installed as she was being sneaky, and the rising cost of living means our gas and electricity bills have increased dramatically, like everyone elses. In Abigails previous place the rent included bills, so she isnt used to worrying about the heating. She just turned everything up to the max when it was cold. That wont wash in my house and Ive told her to be more conscious. Were charging her minimal rent - PS300 a month - so she can save up to move out again next year, but in winter Im considering increasing it to PS375 just to cover additional gas costs. I dont think thats unreasonable. The defence: Abigail I work from home so need the heating on. I feel like a tenant being evicted during the cold Mum and dad love to moan about my use of the heating, but I think its a bit of an overreaction. We have radiators installed for a reason, but they freak out when its time to use them. Central heating is supposed to be turned on when we need it, but they have this militant schedule where everything is timed. If I deviate from it by turning the radiators on at the weekend, or when its just me in the house, they go mad. I work from home more than them, so surely it makes sense that I need to stay warm more. My mums forbidden me from switching on the heating until the temperature drops to zero degrees in the mornings, but Im cold now. Sometimes I have it on when Im in the house alone, but I switch it off before my parents come back. But somehow they still notice. My dad puts his hand behind the radiator and says, A-ha! I knew it, and my mum starts shouting at me, saying Im selfish. They have suggested I go and work in a coffee shop, but I dont see why I should be pushed out of my own home. I feel like a tenant being evicted during the cold. I know Im lucky to pay just PS300 a month in rent, but it would be nice if that wasnt being used against me I was in a houseshare before I moved back home, but it ended as the landlord was selling up and I couldnt find anywhere else affordable in my area. I know heating and bills have increased, but I guess I didnt have to think about it much before, as the rent was all-inclusive. Im saving up to move out again, but with the price of rent in London, it will take me twice as long if they make me spend my salary on overpriced sandwiches in a coffee shop when I could just be working from home. Related: You be the judge: should my gran throw out her hoard of reusable bags? I know Im lucky that my rent is only PS300 a month, but it would be nice if that wasnt being used against me every time I switch on the heating. I get on with my parents quite well, and Im not in a hurry to move out again. I think its a bit silly to panic so much about pennies on the smart meter and ration the heating. We arent well off, but we all work and I pay my way. This obsession with tracking every unit of gas and electricity is just making home a bit less enjoyable for me. The jury of Guardian readers Should Abigail start contributing more towards the heating bills? We had an incredibly mild autumn, but Abigail now needs to get some warmer clothes. I can picture her dancing around the house in her swimwear to Club Tropicana - where heating is free! Seriously though, Abigail needs to pay up or move out.Roberto, 52 Abigail says she pays her way, but is not paying for the extra energy she uses. Its awful to be cold so its understandable she wants the heating on, so why not just pay her parents for the additional energy, rather than go to a coffee shop?Charlie, 41 Abigail only seems to care about her own pennies. If she wants to live at home, she needs to be more considerate of rising energy bills. She should put some extra layers on, rather than turn the heating up.Robyn, 27 Abigail is not guilty. As someone with parents who dont turn on the heating, I can sympathise with her. A cold house is very difficult to put up with. I think it would be better to just charge Abigail for the heating she uses. Dont have a go at her for wanting to be warm now that it has turned cold.Ella, 23 I dont see the need for Abigail to heat the whole house for one person. Get a hot water bottle and some thermals if you want to save money, and buy a portable electric heater if youre still cold. Lying to your parents when theyre letting you stay with them isnt cool.

Just as the publics interest in yoga reached an all-time peak, in-person classes - with all that close bodily proximity and deep breathing - came to an abrupt stop. But a new paradigm emerged almost overnight: coffee tables were pushed aside for yoga mats and this ever-evolving form with its roots in the ascetic practices of medieval India entered the Zoom world. Teachers grappled with video conferencing and online payments, while students figured out how to use the mute button to stop the kids Fortnite sessions from interrupting everyones savasana. Yoga, it turned out, was coming home. A whopping 91% of yoga students and 86% of teachers continued their classes from home, more than double the number who had ever tried an online class before. Two and a half years on, theres a new normal. Many studios have reopened and, much like office life, yoga has settled into a hybrid pattern that combines in-person and at-home practice. But look closer and it isnt so new at all. In the medieval yoga handbook known as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, any serious student is directed to live alone, in a well-administered and virtuous kingdom, and to maintain a spotlessly clean practice room. If, like me, you are 0 for 3 on those, theres a more practical piece of advice in the next verse: yoga should be practised at home, in the way instructed by the guru (teacher). For much of yogas history, solitary practice was typical For the great majority of hatha yogas history (the kind of yoga that includes physical postures, not just philosophy or meditation), a combination of personal instruction and solitary practice at home was typical. You would go to your guru for a new piece of instruction, then return home and practise diligently until you were ready for the next lesson. The group yoga class, where a room full of people all perform the same set of postures simultaneously, is largely a 20th-century invention. From the 1930s onwards, hatha yoga experienced a great revival in its native India. A key group of teachers based in Mysore stirred the traditional practice into a marvellous melting pot of Swedish gymnastics, bodybuilding, Indian classical dance and other strands of physical culture. The resulting fusion became a global success story and gave us the type of yoga class most widely recognised in the west, at least up until 2020: one instructor leading 20 or so students through a 90-minute sequence of postures. With this 20th-century model now well and truly disrupted, what happens next? Despite the obvious losses to the yoga industry in terms of studio closures and teachers forced out of the profession, I believe this reconfiguration is positive for yoga itself. Its a myth that proper yoga is something that only happens in a specific location under professional instruction, and letting go of that idea opens up the possibility for more people to discover the fundamental benefits for themselves. Yogas moral philosophy is centred on self-discipline and personal responsibility; serious students are expected to cultivate qualities of restraint in all areas of their lives, from chastity to non-covetousness, cleanliness and truthfulness. Developing a capacity for self-practice, rather than only following a teachers instructions, feels in keeping with this outlook. And if all that sounds like a lot of hard work and no fun at all, remember there are compensations: alone in your living room, your bodys signals come through loud and clear, peer pressure is a distant memory, and no one can hear you fart. How to do yoga at home Figure out the hybrid that works for you. If youre new to yoga, get plenty of face-to-face teaching while you build basic skills. If youre more experienced, you may be happy with less frequent live classes, supplemented by video classes and self-guided practice. One-to-one sessions with a good teacher can be a revelation, if thats affordable for you. Keep it short and regular. You dont need 90 minutes for every session, because 20-30 minutes works brilliantly if you can do it several times a week, and even 5-10 minutes of regular practice will help. Create a ritual. This will help separate yoga from your everyday and drop you into the right mental space for practice. It neednt be prayer or incense; just put aside the laptop or the Lego, set up the space just the way you like, and enact a gesture or moment of stillness to start and finish each practice. Stay accountable. One of the key tenets of yoga is tapas - not delicious Spanish snacks, sadly, but the Sanskrit word meaning austerity or self-discipline. Checking in with a yoga buddy or keeping a practice diary can help to keep things on track. Make a simple practice plan. Start by considering how you want to feel after your yoga sessions. That will guide you to a key pose (see below for some examples). Working towards that pose, build in a warm-up and some preparatory poses, and experiment with which relaxing counter-poses feel good afterwards. If you feel stuck, just get on the mat and move - youll be surprised how much your body knows. Keep it short and simple: four or five different poses can easily add up to a 20-minute session. Write it down (or, better still, draw a little stick figure doing each pose), so that you can glance at it while you practice and minimise the amount of thought required during your session. Now all you have to do is roll out the mat, ignore the stray sock under the sofa, and get on with it. Do the same sequence each time you practice for at least a week. Pay attention to how you feel afterwards; when youre ready for something new, change it. Five great poses for home practice Downward-facing dog (Adho mukha svanasana) I want to feel: strong and steady. The Indian subcontinent is home to an estimated 35m stray dogs: tough, resourceful and expert at living on the margins. The four-legged pose inspired by their example asks us to find strength and stability in an unfamiliar, upside-down situation - not a bad metaphor for modern life. Downward dog is great for building upper body strength and increasing flexibility in the shoulders; it also stretches the whole back line of the body from the crown to the heels. Warm up to it with cat pose, forward folds, cow face pose and plank; build strength and stamina by lengthening your time in downward dog. Rest in childs pose afterwards. Lord of the dance (Natarajasana) I want to feel: poised and graceful. In Hindu cosmology, the material universe exists in an endless cycle of creation and destruction, governed by a cosmic dance performed by the god Shiva. Full of fierce grace, the pose named after him demands flexibility and focus - its a backbend and a balance in one. At first, you can modify it: rest your hand on a wall and focus on bringing one heel towards your bum. Position your standing leg further from the wall as you gain confidence. Warm up with lunges, cobra, pigeon and one-legged warrior poses; do some forward folds afterwards. Sun salutation (Surya namaskar) I want to feel: dynamic and energised. This flowing sequence is one of the key innovations of the Mysore yoga revival of the 1930s. Its like a very fancy burpee: reach up, reach down, jump back, etc (but make it yoga). Its the mainstay of the majority of dynamic yoga classes, and can become a rather rote activity in that setting. On your own, you get the chance to really explore the form, like a jazz musician: vary the tempo, throw in some wiggly riffs, indulge in a long drum solo. The sun salutation is a mini practice in itself - no particular warm-up needed. Tree pose (Vriksasana) I want to feel: calm and grounded. What more potent symbol of rootedness and reliability could you find than a tree? At its best, this one-legged standing pose is an opportunity to channel the slow peace of the forest in your own living room. Balancing poses also offer a day-by-day insight into your level of ease: take note of your wobbles and extend compassion to your inner wind-whipped sapling. Warm up with slow, gentle sun salutations or similar flowing movements and finish off with a nice lie down. Easy seated pose (Sukhasana) I want to feel: peaceful and centred. Sitting still is in many ways the ultimate goal of a physical yoga practice, and its truly a balm for frazzled hearts and minds. Dont be afraid to dedicate most of your home practice to simply sitting and breathing, particularly when your energy levels are low. The way you cross your legs isnt hugely important: what matters is to find a steady sitting or kneeling pose where you can sit comfortably for 5-10 minutes with an erect spine and relaxed legs. Prepare for it with your choice of warm-up, including some hip mobilisation movements and some seated forward bends and twists.

A key group of teachers based in Mysore stirred the traditional practice into a marvellous melting pot of Swedish gymnastics, bodybuilding, Indian classical dance and other strands of physical culture. The resulting fusion became a global success story and gave us the type of yoga class most widely recognised in the west, at least up until 2020: one instructor leading 20 or so students through a 90-minute sequence of postures. With this 20th-century model now well and truly disrupted, what happens next? Despite the obvious losses to the yoga industry in terms of studio closures and teachers forced out of the profession, I believe this reconfiguration is positive for yoga itself. Its a myth that proper yoga is something that only happens in a specific location under professional instruction, and letting go of that idea opens up the possibility for more people to discover the fundamental benefits for themselves. Yogas moral philosophy is centred on self-discipline and personal responsibility; serious students are expected to cultivate qualities of restraint in all areas of their lives, from chastity to non-covetousness, cleanliness and truthfulness. Developing a capacity for self-practice, rather than only following a teachers instructions, feels in keeping with this outlook. And if all that sounds like a lot of hard work and no fun at all, remember there are compensations: alone in your living room, your bodys signals come through loud and clear, peer pressure is a distant memory, and no one can hear you fart. How to do yoga at home Figure out the hybrid that works for you. If youre new to yoga, get plenty of face-to-face teaching while you build basic skills. If youre more experienced, you may be happy with less frequent live classes, supplemented by video classes and self-guided practice. One-to-one sessions with a good teacher can be a revelation, if thats affordable for you. Keep it short and regular. You dont need 90 minutes for every session, because 20-30 minutes works brilliantly if you can do it several times a week, and even 5-10 minutes of regular practice will help. Create a ritual. This will help separate yoga from your everyday and drop you into the right mental space for practice. It neednt be prayer or incense; just put aside the laptop or the Lego, set up the space just the way you like, and enact a gesture or moment of stillness to start and finish each practice. Stay accountable. One of the key tenets of yoga is tapas - not delicious Spanish snacks, sadly, but the Sanskrit word meaning austerity or self-discipline. Checking in with a yoga buddy or keeping a practice diary can help to keep things on track. Make a simple practice plan. Start by considering how you want to feel after your yoga sessions. That will guide you to a key pose (see below for some examples). Working towards that pose, build in a warm-up and some preparatory poses, and experiment with which relaxing counter-poses feel good afterwards. If you feel stuck, just get on the mat and move - youll be surprised how much your body knows. Keep it short and simple: four or five different poses can easily add up to a 20-minute session. Write it down (or, better still, draw a little stick figure doing each pose), so that you can glance at it while you practice and minimise the amount of thought required during your session. Now all you have to do is roll out the mat, ignore the stray sock under the sofa, and get on with it. Do the same sequence each time you practice for at least a week. Pay attention to how you feel afterwards; when youre ready for something new, change it. Five great poses for home practice Downward-facing dog (Adho mukha svanasana) I want to feel: strong and steady. The Indian subcontinent is home to an estimated 35m stray dogs: tough, resourceful and expert at living on the margins. The four-legged pose inspired by their example asks us to find strength and stability in an unfamiliar, upside-down situation - not a bad metaphor for modern life. Downward dog is great for building upper body strength and increasing flexibility in the shoulders; it also stretches the whole back line of the body from the crown to the heels. Warm up to it with cat pose, forward folds, cow face pose and plank; build strength and stamina by lengthening your time in downward dog. Rest in childs pose afterwards. Lord of the dance (Natarajasana) I want to feel: poised and graceful. In Hindu cosmology, the material universe exists in an endless cycle of creation and destruction, governed by a cosmic dance performed by the god Shiva. Full of fierce grace, the pose named after him demands flexibility and focus - its a backbend and a balance in one. At first, you can modify it: rest your hand on a wall and focus on bringing one heel towards your bum. Position your standing leg further from the wall as you gain confidence. Warm up with lunges, cobra, pigeon and one-legged warrior poses; do some forward folds afterwards. Sun salutation (Surya namaskar) I want to feel: dynamic and energised. This flowing sequence is one of the key innovations of the Mysore yoga revival of the 1930s. Its like a very fancy burpee: reach up, reach down, jump back, etc (but make it yoga). Its the mainstay of the majority of dynamic yoga classes, and can become a rather rote activity in that setting. On your own, you get the chance to really explore the form, like a jazz musician: vary the tempo, throw in some wiggly riffs, indulge in a long drum solo. The sun salutation is a mini practice in itself - no particular warm-up needed. Tree pose (Vriksasana) I want to feel: calm and grounded. What more potent symbol of rootedness and reliability could you find than a tree? At its best, this one-legged standing pose is an opportunity to channel the slow peace of the forest in your own living room. Balancing poses also offer a day-by-day insight into your level of ease: take note of your wobbles and extend compassion to your inner wind-whipped sapling. Warm up with slow, gentle sun salutations or similar flowing movements and finish off with a nice lie down. Easy seated pose (Sukhasana) I want to feel: peaceful and centred. Sitting still is in many ways the ultimate goal of a physical yoga practice, and its truly a balm for frazzled hearts and minds. Dont be afraid to dedicate most of your home practice to simply sitting and breathing, particularly when your energy levels are low. The way you cross your legs isnt hugely important: what matters is to find a steady sitting or kneeling pose where you can sit comfortably for 5-10 minutes with an erect spine and relaxed legs. Prepare for it with your choice of warm-up, including some hip mobilisation movements and some seated forward bends and twists.

More than four in five workers - 84% - told the Office for National Statistics (ONS) they wanted to continue splitting their time between home and the office after the pandemic, while the ONS also found hybrid working patterns had shifted towards employees spending more working hours at home. Ever since the pandemic shook up working patterns and location, the majority of employees have been demanding more flexibility, in marked contrast to the governments recent push to bring workers back to city centre desks to boost the service businesses dependent on trade from passing office workers. The Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was widely criticised after it emerged he had toured government departments to monitor how many civil servants were present, leaving notes on empty desks. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson claimed staff working from home might be easily distracted by making coffee and eating cheese, as he had, adding that he believed people are more productive, more energetic, more full of ideas when surrounded by colleagues. The ONS found improved work-life balance was reported to be the main benefit of working from home for at least some of the week, cited by 78% of the workers who split their time between office and home. Meanwhile, half (52%) of hybrid workers told the survey they found it quicker to complete their work at home, mostly because there were fewer distractions, while almost half (47%) reported improved wellbeing as a result of increased home working. Interactive The Bank of England is one of the employers that will be forced to accept hybrid working on a permanent basis, according to its governor, as it faces demands for remote working from new recruits. Andrew Bailey told the podcast Jimmys Jobs of the Future that while he wanted to see people return to the office in greater numbers, there was an expectation among skilled jobseekers that home working would form part of their employment at the central bank. As employers we are all having to face the fact that we are having to recruit people in a job market where that is increasingly part of the work-life balance, Bailey said. It has to be said that organisations have proved you can do more things with home working than you thought you could. Interactive However, Bailey also stressed the importance of workers spending some time in the office to ensure more experienced colleagues could pass on skills to younger members of staff. The Banks governor faced criticism last week, including from a Conservative former cabinet minister, after it was revealed the central bank allowed its staff to work from home for four days a week. Liam Fox told the Daily Mail that the Bank should be doing all it could to help the economy, adding that it seemed strange staff were largely not in their place of work. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Bailey, who said he recognised the Bank had come under fire in some quarters for a slow return to the office, stressed he would try to find a balance between insisting staff attend in-person meetings in Threadneedle Street and working from home. I do think you get benefits from having face-to-face contact that you dont get on the screen. And how do you make the staff who join us get the same benefits that we all had working with and interacting with people? He said he was worried about the ability of new staff and especially younger staff who for the last two years it has been far more difficult to acquire that knowledge of how things are done. He added: It is important people come to work but we are going to balance it.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/dec\/07\/englands-affordable-housing-scheme-falls-32000-homes-short-of-target","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/dec\/07\/englands-affordable-housing-scheme-falls-32000-homes-short-of-target","DATE":"2022-12-07 00:01:25","PLAIN_TEXT":"A PS21bn government programme to build more affordable housing in England is missing its target by 32,000 homes with big shortfalls in rural areas, MPs have said. The affordable homes programme also risks falling further behind because Michael Goves Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities does not seem to have a grasp of risks ahead including soaring construction inflation, according to the public accounts committee. A new below-inflation cap on social rent increases could also limit new building, it says. The programme involves grants distributed to housing associations but under the 2016 programme only 241,000 of the target of 250,000 homes will be built. In the latest wave, started in 2021, only 157,000 of the target of 180,000 will be built. About 1.2 million households are on waiting lists for social housing in England, the highest number since 2016, and there are rising concerns about safety after the death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak from mould in a social housing property in Rochdale. On Tuesday, the housing ombudsman levied its latest fine on a social landlord for mould - ordering Orbit housing to pay a tenant PS5,000 over its handling of reports of damp and mould due to multiple failures to complete repairs over two years. The human cost of inaction is already affecting thousands of households and now the building programme is hitting the challenges of increased building costs, said Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee. This does not augur well for generation rent or those in desperate need of genuinely affordable homes. Homes England, the main agency that distributes the funds, has made grants for only 6,250 rural homes, about half the number required under the policy. In 2020, there were more than a quarter of a million people on a housing waiting list in rural areas but fewer than 4,500 social homes were built in 2019-20, according to the Country Land and Business Association. The shortfall identified by the cross-party Commons committee comes as Gove faces allegations of negligence from builders in abandoning local housebuilding targets in the face of Tory backbench rebellion this week. In a move attacked by critics as enshrining nimbyism, Goves department said targets would only be a starting point with new flexibilities to reflect local circumstances and new development must have the support of local communities. Councils backed the move and said it was right that top-down algorithms and formulas can never be a substitute for local knowledge. But the industry lobby group, the Home Builders Federation, fears it could result in 100,000 fewer homes being built annually. Builders started work on 180,000 homes in England in the last year, according to official data. If ministers fail to stand up to the anti-business and anti-development section of the Conservative party, it is inevitable that housing supply will fall dramatically, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs, slashing GDP and preventing even more people from accessing decent housing, said Neil Jefferson, the HBF managing director. The MPs also highlighted the governments decision to demand half of the affordable homes built under the 2021 programme were for ownership rather than rental, given building homes for social rent offers best value for money by slashing the need for costly temporary accommodation. In London, a grant to build a new social home is more than paid back by housing benefit savings over 60 years and is 69% repaid in 30 years, according to the governments own sums. David Renard, the housing spokesperson at the Local Government Association, said: The social housing supply is not sufficient to meet the current housing demand, which is why we want to see long-term plans to give councils powers to build 100,000 high-quality, climate-friendly social homes a year. A spokesperson for the Dpartment for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: The secretary of state agrees with the committee that we must build more homes for social rent. Increasing the number of genuinely affordable homes is central to our levelling up mission and were investing PS11.5bn to build more of the affordable, quality homes this country needs. Before the pandemic we had reached the highest rate of housebuilding in 30 years and since 2010 we have built more than 630,000 affordable homes in England, including 162,000 for social rent. But there is much more to do and we look forward to working with the committee on their recommendations.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/jan\/15\/maybe-i-should-just-stop-and-enjoy-my-life-how-the-pandemic-is-making-us-rethink-work","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/jan\/15\/maybe-i-should-just-stop-and-enjoy-my-life-how-the-pandemic-is-making-us-rethink-work","DATE":"2022-01-14 19:00:01","PLAIN_TEXT":"When the pandemic struck Australia in March 2020, academics began losing their jobs in droves. Within a year, 20% of people employed in tertiary education had lost their jobs. And every day for 18 months, union organiser Frank Gafa would take their calls. I was day in, day out sitting in my house talking to people on the phone who were losing their jobs, the Wailwan and Wiradjuri man says. It was pretty intense and I didnt really acknowledge it ... thats actually pretty traumatic to sit and listen to peoples trauma. For most of that time Melbourne, where Gafa lives, was in lockdown. Social and community activities were restricted - work was all that was left. And, like thousands of others - working from their bedrooms or kitchen tables, or wearing a mask providing a frontline service - he realised it wasnt enough. Like thousands of others confronting their own work-life balance during the pandemic, he realised he needed to do things differently. By August 2021, Gafa was burned out. He quit his job and started a new one, without taking a break. One month into his new role he realised his mistake: he did not need a change. He needed a holiday. Related: What do we do with our finite life?: how Covid reframed our relationship with ourselves I had this really unhealthy relationship with work where I had to be forced to go on leave, he says. So I had this little crisis of, maybe I could actually just have a break rather than keep pushing on? Maybe I should just stop and enjoy my life. He returned to the union and cashed in his unused leave to take three months off. The first few weeks were spent without his laptop, his first holiday without a computer for 10 years. His newfound resolution is to take regular breaks once he returns to work. To find a better balance. The hardest part will be keeping it. Being a union organiser is really central to my identity, he says. I dont know what I would do if I just got a normal, nine-to-five desk job. I think I might be lost. Some frustrated with work have been able to restructure their lives through changes in location, career or remote working, but others remain stuck. Photograph: Tom WernerGetty Images The pandemic forced many Australians to reevaluate their relationship to work and the central role it plays in our lives and identities. For many, the shift to working from home provided the space and time needed to make big decisions. When Guardian Australia asked readers whether the pandemic had made them reassess their lives, dozens responded by saying they quit or were considering quitting jobs that they did not like or that demanded too much of them. They turned down work in favour of activities they actually enjoyed, scaled back their need for material possessions, and in some cases retired early, choosing to live a more restrained life on the pension than continue in a job they hated. Many said they quit jobs that did not align with their values to take on more meaningful work; others vowed not to let work - any work - dominate their lives any longer. The pandemic pushed me to make my life become meaningful again, says Rosie Pavlovic, who quit her job and moved to New Zealand to be with her long-distance girlfriend. I never want to work for something I dont believe in. Some have been able to restructure their lives through remote work, a change of career, or a change of location. But many - because of insecure work or choices restricted by debt, poverty and family obligations - remain stuck. David Thompson* is one of the stuck. Before the pandemic he was aware that he was bored out of my mind doing his well-paid office job but I could distract myself with plans and holidays. Thats not really the case any more, he says. And once thats gone you just kind of look around and think, what am I left with? Thompson never really found his calling. He did all the right things: excelled at school and graduated with a science degree from a good university, with the aim of finding any job that I can tolerate that earns me enough money to fund the lifestyle that I want. That lifestyle is not extravagant, but it has expanded to fill his income. He could not afford to maintain it and to pay the mortgage if he were to start over in a different career, and wont risk his childrens financial security to secure his own happiness. If you have something that you can grab onto now, and you really love, then by all means follow that David Thompson* Thompson is determined that his children, facing global existential challenges, will have a different life. I say to them, if you have something that you can grab onto now, and you really love, then by all means follow that and if you dont make a lot of money doing it, I dont care. You can live with us. Because the other way, I dont think happiness lives there. Its what I want to do with my life Joshua Badge, a Melbourne-based writer and academic, did place meaningful, fulfilling work over financial gain, and it left them close to homelessness. Their teaching contract at a Melbourne university ended and they were left without the bulk of their income. They had been working as a writer on the side - but without teaching, writing became their mainstay. Partly out of necessity I threw myself into work, working more than I ever had ... often 9am to midnight, they say. They skated on the edge of financial catastrophe for months. Work - the freelance researching which paid their bills - felt pointless against the backdrop of global catastrophe, and there are more catastrophes on the horizon. There is a real sense of nihilism about that, Badge says. The immediate material needs aside, why should we be working at all? What is the point of it? Related: The pandemic has allowed us to see so much. What will we do with our newfound clarity? But the crisis did lead to a shift in identity: now when Badge is asked, so what do you do? they answer: Im a writer. I now tend to answer with what I want to be doing first and what Im doing for money second, they say. [Writing] is not remunerative at all. But its what I love to do and what I want to do with my life. Badge is clear that they are choosing a life of doing what they love over a life of financial stability because the latter does not even feel like an option. Owning a home feels out of reach; many of their peers are living in sharehouses in their 40s. If work was more stable, those same people might be taking long service leave at this point in their careers. Instead, they are burning out. A movement of working less Kristin OConnell was granted the disability support pension in early 2020, after illness stymied her career in the not-for-profit sector. She spent the last two years working with the Unemployed Workers Union to support and advocate for those navigating the pandemic on below-poverty line jobless benefits. It is hard, uncompensated work, and caused her to unpick one of the fundamental tenets of modern society: that work is inherently tied to income. Lots of extremely valuable labor is unpaid, and lots of totally worthless labor is highly paid, she says. In a roundabout way, she says, the pandemic exposed more privileged people to the idea of unpaid work: as their office jobs went remote, they suddenly had time to pursue other interests. OConnell hopes the desire to keep that time may build into a movement of working less. That provides more opportunity for everyone to do more unpaid work that gives them satisfaction in their life and helps them support people who they care about. But OConnell is not hopeful the change in attitudes to low-paid and unpaid work will outlast the crisis. She has already watched as the federal government doubled unemployment benefits overnight then shrunk them back a year later, with minimal protest. None of those changes stuck with people. A flexible future? While causing some to reconsider the point of work, for many the pandemic fundamentally reshaped how and where they worked. A Productivity Commission report from last September said that up to 40% of Australian workers had worked from home during the pandemic, up from ABS estimates of about 24% doing at least one day a week at home in March 2020. The Productivity Commission found that for some working from home was a welcome and hopefully permanent change, and others an additional stressor as lines between work and personal time became blurred. One reader told Guardian Australia their workplace had become fully flexible and they did not plan to go into the office more than one day a week this year. This is huge for me as a neurodivergent person and a single parent, they said. I am much more committed to my job and have produced more in the last two years than in previous years ... I have also become much closer with my children, as I was working full time out of the home previously. Another said they felt the pandemic had eased the stigma on men working from home, or adopting more caring responsibilities. I am prioritising myself and my career but not at the detriment of everything else. One reader said that the pandemic had made it more acceptable for men to work from home, and made them ensure their work was not prioritised above everything else. Photograph: Eva-KatalinGetty Images Others said working from home made them feel isolated and overwhelmed. The pandemic increased rates of burnout, particularly among women, says Australian researcher Gabriela Tavella. Tavella has spent the past few years researching burnout as a workplace disease alongside Prof Gordon Parker at the University of New South Wales. The pandemic has seen women disproportionately affected by burnout because of a phenomenon called the second shift, which is when you come home from work and then have to take on primary care and homemaking duties - a second shift of work, she says. These workloads, during the pandemic, overlapped. But despite the impact it had on women with children, Tavella says working from home during the pandemic allowed some people to reclaim time that would otherwise be spent in long commutes, resulting in a better work-life balance. According to a June 2021 report by the ABS, working from home and spending more time with friends and family were the two elements of life under Covid that people most wanted to retain after the pandemic. Instead of getting on a train at 6am, people could sleep later, go for a walk, and still make their 9am meeting. They could do laundry and other tasks in their lunch break, freeing up their weekends for other pursuits. Related: I understand my kid more: how the pandemic changed parenting For many workers, the risk of blurred boundaries between personal and work time is heavily outweighed by the freedom and flexibility of working from home. A report by the Australia Institutes Centre for Future Work found that despite concerns about unpaid overtime and so on, 65% of people working from home expected to continue doing so after the pandemic. Major workplaces have responded by introducing more flexible working. The Victorian public service now offers flexible working on all jobs. New South Wales public service, Telstra, and major accounting firms Deloitte and EY all did so prior to the pandemic. A 2021 study by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency found that four out of five workplaces of more than 100 employees had formal flexible workplace policies, and that there was an overall upward trend in the number of employers doing so. Flexible work, it said, had the capacity to improve worker satisfaction, productivity and gender equality. The pandemic increased burnout rates, particularly for women with caring responsibilities. Yet for many, the flexibility offered by working from home was something they wanted to hold on to after lockdowns. Photograph: MaskotGetty Images But Australian workplaces have been slower to introduce fully remote work, meaning people still need to live close enough to their workplace to go in a few times a week. Employment lawyer Rob Jackson expects that to change. At the moment people are still trying to recover from the shock of the pandemic and what it all means, and some are defaulting back to what was normal two years ago, he says. But I think in 10 years time that working from home model will be much more commonplace. Traditional employers will see the cost-benefits of not having an office once they realise that the world hasnt fallen apart. Jackson says there are some rational arguments for working from the office. Face-to-face meetings are still believed more effective than those which take place on video conferencing, and it is important for staff morale and workplace cohesion that employees know each other as more than a series of tiles on a group video call at the weekly team meeting, like a workplace game of Guess Who. But there is also a strand of presenteeism among employers who want employers in the office, five days a week, where they can be supervised. Thats a mentality, Jackson says, which is likely to be rejected by workers who have the option to move on. There will be diehards who will maintain that five days a week, Monday to Friday, in the office, is the only way to operate. But I think theyre going to be in an increasing minority. *some names have been changed.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/jun\/18\/office-hybrid-or-home-businesses-ponder-future-of-work","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/jun\/18\/office-hybrid-or-home-businesses-ponder-future-of-work","DATE":"2021-06-18 05:00:02","PLAIN_TEXT":"The government could announce an end to its work from home guidance in England next month, leaving companies with three broad choices: bring everyone back to the office; introduce a flexible working regime; or allow people to work from their home office, kitchen table or garden shed permanently. Here we look at the pros and cons of each option. 1. Back to the office Major investment banks have taken some of the most hardline positions on return-to-office plans, meaning staff will soon have to return to their daily commutes into London. The boss of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, dashed bankers hopes of splitting their time between home and office in February when he called remote working an aberration that needed to be corrected as soon as possible. Morgan Stanleys chief executive, James Gorman, told his New York bankers this week that anyone who felt safe going out to a restaurant should be returning to the office. Gorman said the bank would take a different approach in countries such as the UK, where fewer than 25% of its 5,000 London staff have been going to work in person, due to stricter Covid restrictions, but insisted offices were where bankers learned their craft. Thats where you build all the soft cues that go with having a successful career that arent just about Zoom presentations, he said. Goldmans US staff marched back to their desks on Monday and its 6,000 UK bankers are expected to return to the Plumtree Court offices in London as soon as government work from home orders are lifted, potentially on 19 July. About 30% of Goldmans UK staff are going into the London office on a regular basis and are being tested twice a week by on-site medical staff as part of safety measures. While it has stopped short of demanding UK staff disclose their vaccination status, as has been asked of their American counterparts, an anonymous survey revealed the majority of its London workforce will have had at least one jab by next week. Solomon is reportedly concerned that staff have been abusing work from home privileges, citing an incident last year when a junior employee approached him in the middle of the working day while they were dining in the Hamptons - 80 miles outside New York City. The chief executive said he was particularly worried about how to train the next generation of bankers if most staff were working from home. The JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has also raised concerns about a lack of mentoring for young staff and a small drop in productivity on Mondays and Fridays. Likewise, the Barclays boss, Jes Staley, has bemoaned the challenges faced by young graduates and new hires, who needed to be immersed in the culture and the values of the bank by meeting colleagues face to face. 2. Hybrid working For the majority of large corporates, the future is hybrid. Some of the UKs largest office occupiers, from the big four accountancy firms to major tech firms, all intend to allow more flexible working after the pandemic, with staff splitting their time between their desk and a remote location. Working from home is increasingly being demanded as a permanent arrangement by staff, especially younger workers. But company bosses are also aware of the bank bosses argument: the benefits of bringing teams together in a communal workplace to foster collaboration and corporate culture, while also helping to train younger employees and new starters, who may not have the luxury of a dedicated workspace at home. As a result many corporates have opted for the compromise of hybrid working. The accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has announced a flexible working policy for its 22,000 UK staff, allowing them to split the week between their home and office, which the chair, Kevin Ellis, said was a direct response to soundings from our people. The company expects workers to spend 40-60% of their time with colleagues, whether at PwCs offices or on client visits, and with the freedom to work remotely the rest of the week. Despite the firm stance taken by Goldman, some City firms have gone hybrid too. The FTSE-listed fund manager Schroders is among those that have told staff they will not be required to return to the office full-time. The consumer goods group Unilever, the owner of brands including Dove soap, Marmite and Ben &amp; Jerrys ice-cream, has said staff will never return to a five-days-a-week office pattern. Its chief executive, Alan Jope, has called the previous approach very old-fashioned. Even technology firms, which should be at the vanguard of video conferencing, are favouring a half-and-half approach. Googles chief executive, Sundar Pichai, announced a hybrid policy in May, with staff spending about three days in the office and two days wherever they work best, similar to the approach adopted by Amazon. However, he added that once the pandemic is over we will be able to come back together in our offices to see all the people we have missed. More than two-thirds (66%) of businesses continue to offer some remote working, according to a survey from the British Chambers of Commerce. The poll of more than 900 businesses showed almost three-quarters of firms expected at least one team member to continue working remotely over the coming year. However, companies ability to offer flexible working varies greatly according to sector, and is far more prevalent in service businesses such as financial or law firms, and far less simple to implement in hospitality, retail or manufacturing. Some companies have seized the opportunity to wave goodbye to the office. Photograph: Joe GiddensPA 3. Permanent remote working During the pandemic some companies have seized the opportunity to wave goodbye to the office for good, slashing rental costs. Bosses have sent laptops and monitors, and in some cases desks and office chairs, to their workers, equipping them to work from home for good. The outsourcing firm Capita announced last year that the majority of its 900 new hires, taken on to manage Londons congestion charge and low-emission zones for its contracts with Transport for London (TfL), would be allowed to work remotely and encouraged to do so from home. Capita has also expanded its office closure plans as part of a cost-cutting drive, with the goal of permanently closing a quarter of its office space by the end of 2021. Yet just 4% of firms across all sectors intend to have their staff work exclusively from home, excluding major meetings and away days, according to a survey by the Federation of Small Businesses. Smaller firms tend to be more flexible and adaptive than big corporates by nature, enabling teams to arrive at arrangements that work for all, said the FSBs national chair, Mike Cherry. Some larger companies have also decided to adopt permanent remote working, and not just as a means of cutting costs. Facebooks chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told workers earlier in June that all full-time employees would be allowed to work remotely if their job allowed it, something he intends to do himself 50% of the time. Weve learned over the past year that good work can get done anywhere, and Im even more optimistic that remote work at scale is possible, he wrote in a staff memo. About one in three staff at Natwest Group, representing more than 20,000 workers, will become largely remote workers, able to live and work anywhere in the UK and only required to attend their office in person for two days a month. The number of remote working roles advertised in the UK has risen steadily over the past year, reaching approximately 145,000 jobs in May, equivalent to about 5% of advertised jobs. This means the number of remote jobs being advertised has more than trebled compared with last August, and increased sixfold since February 2020, according to the labour market data company Emsi. However, talent consultants warn that working from home does not suit all staff, with some finding it hard to remain productive and motivated. Few workers want to do away with visiting their workplace, said Natalie Douglass, the director of talent strategy consulting at New Street Consulting Group. What a lot of workers have discovered over the past year is that having the option to work remotely can be good but not having the option to go to the office at all can make a job much harder, Douglass said.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/nov\/17\/she-dropped-three-cheese-and-onion-crisps-and-a-tooth-into-my-hand-what-happened-when-marie-kondo-tidied-my-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/nov\/17\/she-dropped-three-cheese-and-onion-crisps-and-a-tooth-into-my-hand-what-happened-when-marie-kondo-tidied-my-home","DATE":"2022-11-17 06:00:43","PLAIN_TEXT":"How do you tidy up before Marie Kondo arrives at your house? The 38-year-old queen of domestic serenity has been bossing chaos since 2011, when she published The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Then in 2016 came Spark Joy, an illustrated follow-up, and pretty soon the entire world - Im not exaggerating - was familiar with her principles: separate your belongings into categories: clothes, books, papers, miscellany, sentimental items. Go through, in that order, and pick up each item, hold it in your hands, ask yourself if it sparks joy. If it doesnt, discard it. For the things that you decide to let go, you thank it for having sparked joy in the past, she tells me later, through an interpreter. Out loud? I ask, appalled. Silently is fine. All that remains is to decide where to put your joy-sparking items. Pause for a second, here: I have been scoffing at the notion of thanking objects since I read Kondos handbag advice (youre meant to thank it at the end of each day), but that is cloth-eared. The Shinto religion - Kondo isnt incredibly observant, but was a miko (shrine maiden) in her late teens - is animist, and holds that some inanimate objects can gain a soul after 100 years of service. So there is nothing ridiculous about feeling gratitude to a thing; ridiculous is clinging on to a thing that plainly doesnt have a soul. The task in hand: Zoes desk. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca DragoiThe Guardian Kondo is only going to tidy my desk, so my whole-house tidy was precautionary and a little bit chastening. There was an empty beer bottle on my bedside table, right there, where regular people keep books. Downstairs, there was a book face down in some sauce. Never mind untidy, why am I so disgusting? She arrived at my house as - no offence, everyone - the most perfect person who has ever set foot in it: radiant with calm, fine-boned and beautiful like a statue, collected, curious. As a result of her Netflix series Sparking Joy (in 2021) and Tidying Up (2019), she has become an obsession with my nieces, and they are here, too, pretending to be yet more of my children. Im affecting to have five children, three of whom are 15 and look nothing alike. While Im wondering what my answer will be, should she ask me whether all these teenagers spark joy (some of them, some of the time), the younger niece proffers an origami flower she has made. It is an exquisite moment, a disciple of tidiness meeting her prophet, bonding wordlessly over this perfect, neat thing. It made it into Kondos handbag, so it must have sparked joy; either that, or there is a hard edge where manners meet tidy-rules, and manners win. She doesnt say that in the books, and thats half my stuff: things that I cant throw away because someone gave them to me. OK, a 10th of my stuff. How did this happen? Kondo grew up in Tokyo in a regular family, with two siblings. My parents are what I would call ordinary people. Theyre not particularly tidy. Theyre not particularly untidy, she says. Her singular passion for organising was manifest by her earliest schooldays, and by the time she got to Tokyo Womans Christian University to study sociology, she was regularly introducing her friends to her KonMari method. At 19, strangers were asking her to tidy for them, and she started her organising consultancy business - an empire was in the making. Getting stuck in ... Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca DragoiThe Guardian Her new book, Marie Kondos Kurashi at Home, ventures into new realms: gardens, fermentation, living spaces that foster conversation. This gestalt approach reflects, I think, the fact that once people have adopted her tidying method, it is so life-changing that they want her to tell them how to do everything. She has come straight from a book launch in central London, where people in the audience were describing major life changes that started when they adopted the KonMari method, and this, to Kondo, makes perfect sense: Through tidying, you would have to repeat the process of finding things that spark joy or not. And through doing that many, many times, you will improve your sense of finding out what sparks joy in your life and what doesnt. That can be applied not just to objects but also to people. Gradually, people would start changing what kind of person they want to date, or what kind of job they think might spark joy. Thats how life can change. So, theres a problem with my desk: it will take more than two hours. Can we do my husbands desk instead? Sure, the worst that could happen would be that I throw away his mini-USB. Since clothes are not typically found on desks, we start on books. She places in my hands Enabling Collaboration - Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships, and asks, does it spark joy? This question is so absurd that I can hardly stop laughing. Oh my God, it was boring. Five minutes in, we have discarded all his books, except, realistically, I dont think we can. What I do is really fun ... Marie Kondo. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca DragoiThe Guardian Maybe we have to do your desk, Kondo says. It turns out that Im going to disrupt her system, because there are clothes on my desk, but we dont find that out until much, much later. Deliciously, she calls them textiles; they cant be clothes, if they were, wed have done them first, and what kind of maniac keeps their friends scarf, a spare school tie and a T-shirt underneath 17 years of bank statements? Kondos thesis, at the end of her degree, was titled Tidying up as seen from the perspective of gender, which argued that while tidying shouldnt be seen as the preserve of women, they did seem to have a closer connection with their physical surroundings. The subject is unavoidable: tidiness as a component of femininity, allied to restraint, order, the suppression of base impulse, is half the reason I wont tidy. The tide of Kondos career, though, has made her think that maybe this isnt a girl-thing: When it comes to just possessing things and thinking about what you want to possess, I think its the same for any gender. I keep hearing people who say they listened to my method, they tidied and their lives changed, many men as well. I just happen to be a woman, thats all. Although its true that among my readers, there are more women. What kind of maniac keeps their friends scarf, a spare school tie and a T-shirt underneath 17 years of bank statements? She married Takumi Kawahara, who is now CEO of KonMari Media, in 2012. In Kurashi at Home, she takes on the dilemma, Help, my partners messy! (the answer, by the way, is to be so tidy yourself that it encourages them to change), but this relates in no way to her marriage. Perhaps my husband is tidier than me. I love my job of telling people the value of tidying, however I wouldnt say my house is perfectly tidy, she says. Do these spark joy? Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca DragoiThe Guardian Once you start tidying, she tells me, back at my desk, your hurdle for throwing things away is not as high as you think. The books were incredibly easy (are you ever going to read a Charles Cumming spy novel twice?), the paperwork straightforward (my bin is overflowing). We are on to miscellany: a toothbrush; nine pairs of sunglasses; a stick; a wrap you would put round your knuckles before a boxing glove, but only one of them, and anyway, when did I last box? Its so completely random, they belong in an Art Garfunkel song. Generally, she just very gently nudges stuff towards me but, at one point, she drops into my palm, with her ee cummings-small hands, three loose cheese-and-onion crisps and a tooth. Do these spark joy? I have no idea how, but she and the interpreter manage to remain deadpan. In fact, the tooth was my daughters, so has a sentiment attached, but its not joy; it didnt come out on its own, but had to be wrenched from her tiny head, and all the way home, she said: I wish that hadnt happened. What Im holding on to is an incredibly horrible memory. I stare at it for ages. Its better with sentimental items to put them in a box and deal with all of them together, she says. Imagine that - everything in your life with a memory attached, in one place, having to decide which you want to keep, and where you are going to keep it. How long would that take? What state would you be in at the end of it? Would you have a display cabinet, for teeth? Related: File fashion: how to organise your wardrobe to make getting dressed easier Kondo had her first daughter in 2015, her second the next year, and has always said that its perfectly possible to be tidy and have children - you just have to incorporate them into your routine, make tidying up into a game. Then, last year, she had her third child, a son. After the first, slowly, gradually, I returned to order, and after the second, it was faster; after the third, I just thought, tidying has become impossible. My daily life is so chaotic. So, of course, I try as much as possible. But I dont have time and children just keep undoing all my tidying. So my strength is I just know that I know how to tidy, so Ive positively given up on the tidiness. I decided this is a time in my life that I spend with my children. Im sure Ive said before that, even with children, I can still tidy, she carries on. However, I feel that people can change, and were allowed to change. Lady, I want to say, you dont have to explain yourself to me. Ive still got a tooth in my pocket that I cant work out what to do with. But I decide on balance that this would put too much pressure on the interpreter. Some general rules for a peaceful desk: never stack books or notebooks spine-sideways, always vertically. Its much more pleasing to the eye. When you open a drawer, you should be able to see everything in it. Rootling is the enemy of order. There should be nothing on the surface that youre not working on in that moment except, at a pinch, personal care items (lip balm, eye drops) and one ornament. My desk itself has sentimental value: it was one of the hotly contested items in my parents separation circa 1976, and somehow my dad got it, which was weird as it was originally a present from my mums friend. Then, when I bought my first flat a quarter-century later, he gave it to me, just to annoy my mother. I really feel like all that long-range animus and constant mischief has informed who I am, in a good way. Shinto-wise, I think it probably does have a soul, but I havent seen the surface of it in years, maybe never. I love it like this. Three whole days have passed and its still completely clear. The floors a bomb site. Behold the clutter-free desk. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca DragoiThe Guardian The Japanese tsunami of March 2011 changed the context of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. There was speculation afterwards that the magnitude of that loss - more than 20,000 people, 120,000 buildings, a nuclear disaster - and the emotional wrench of having to rebuild in its wake made people think more searchingly about stuff: what does any of it matter? What are you clinging on to? But that success was replicated more or less everywhere her books were translated: even before the Netflix series boosted her profile, Kondos books were bestsellers in Europe and the US. Actually, the reaction has been really unanimous, to my surprise, she says. I used to think that American houses are so big that maybe they dont have this issue of having to tidy your house. But as soon as I went to America, I realised people have the same struggle: having too many things and not having enough storage and having guilt in throwing things away. She and her family split their time, now, between Tokyo and California. There are cosmetic cultural differences - in Japan, books are cheaper, more like magazines, so people are chiller about throwing them out - but fundamentally were all the same, under the skin; we would all like to see the surface of our desk. Some of us just dont know it yet. What I do is really fun, she says, I have lots of different positive feelings from it. Fun is the first thing. Also, theres the reassurance and the happiness, when I see things are where they should be. Nothing fazes her, least of all chaos. I have a joy in seeing room for tidying. I will probably never completely understand, but Im happy shes happy.

The consultancy Advanced Workplace Associates (AWA) surveyed 43 offices in the UK, covering nearly 50,000 workers, in June and July. The report found that the average attendance was 29% - just 1.45 days of a standard five-day working week - peaking at 39% mid-week. Offices are at their quietest on Fridays, at 13% attendance, and Mondays, when less than a fifth of workers go in (19%). Due to the pandemic, the hybrid-working genie is out of the bottle, said Andrew Mawson, the managing director of AWA. The global report found that those working in the banking industry had the highest average weekly office attendance rate at 47%, while the tech and logistics industries were most likely to work from home, heading to the office just 15% of the time. The report also found that when companies had no hybrid-working policy, people came in on average less than one day a week. Even companies that try to force staff to attend three days a week struggle, with employees going into work on average just 2.1 days a week. When an employer trusts its workers to make their own decisions about office attendance, the average is two days in the office a week. Even where employers try to force staff into the office two or three days a week, employees dont comply, said Mawson. Organisations need to look at the data showing that two-thirds of desks are unused and work with their employees to find smarter, more efficient ways of working that will fit in with how people want to live their lives, save money and be more environmentally friendly. The AWA says previous surveys conducted during Covid found that before the pandemic workers were coming into the office on average 3.8 days a week. In a survey of 36 offices in 12 other countries, the AWA found workers were attending the office just 1.4 days a week - 26% lower than the UK average.

Almost 1m entries or exits to the capitals tube system - Britains busiest public transport network - were recorded before 10am, about 220,000 fewer trips than the previous Monday, as official guidance to work from home where possible came into effect. Following the measures announced last week by Boris Johnson to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, Network Rail said footfall in the largest city stations it manages was down about 20-25% from a week ago, with the biggest drop, of 38%, at Londons Cannon Street, serving the City. Leeds station recorded 35% fewer passengers, Birmingham 24% fewer, while numbers in Glasgow - in Scotland, where guidance was already to work from home where possible - were down 7%. There were 17% fewer people at Manchester Piccadilly, and 30% fewer passengers on Manchesters Metrolink tram system, according to Transport for Greater Manchester. Bus travel in London was down less sharply, with 6% fewer passengers travelling before 10am. Tube usage started to fall back in the second half of last week after the governments plan B announcement, with passenger numbers down between 3% and 5% on the previous weeks mornings. The morning rush hour has now fallen back to below half of pre-pandemic levels, at 46% of normal. However, a greater proportion of people are now using Transport for Londons services later in the day, for work and leisure, possibly attending still-permitted Christmas parties and shopping. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The reduction in passengers will further hit TfLs battered finances. On Monday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, confirmed to the Commons a week-long extension to the governments financial support for the capital, after talks over longer-term funding failed to reach agreement before the weekend deadline. Shapps said the decision would provide continued support to and certainty to Londoners while we work with TfL on their funding needs. Data unavailable for train or bus travel nationwide. Provisional rail figures from the start of December suggested weekday travel has started to decline from a 2021 peak of just over 70% of normal levels, although weather-related delays as well as fears over renewed Covid transmission were a factor. Despite the fall in numbers in rush hour on Monday, early retail data suggested that plenty of people - working from home or otherwise - were still managing to reach UK shops. Retail figures showed a rise in footfall in UK high streets, up 11% week on week, particularly in market towns, which have smaller, more local high streets and were 25% busier than last Monday. However, central London was a less appealing prospect for some, with footfall in the capitals shopping districts down 10% week on week. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, which compiled the data, said the drop in London demonstrated the size of the office working population, and the impact of the reduction of this on activity in the capital. While the figures overall remain some way below 2019 levels, the new instructions on home working may have boosted some shops ahead of Christmas, Wehrle said. Despite plan B restrictions coming into force today, UK footfall [across all retail destinations] over the period up to 12pm on Monday is higher than last week (+5.2%). It appears that despite the working from home guidance, footfall is being insulated by Christmas shopping - indeed, it may actually be due to the working from home guidance that footfall has risen, as shoppers feel less nervous in visiting stores and destinations as they anticipate locations wont be as crowded, she said.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"environment\/2021\/aug\/03\/woman-killed-attack-black-bear-remote-alberta-forest","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2021\/aug\/03\/woman-killed-attack-black-bear-remote-alberta-forest","DATE":"2021-08-03 16:36:25","PLAIN_TEXT":"Police in Canada say a 26-year-old woman working as a helicopter engineer in Alberta was killed by a black bear on Saturday, in a rare attack by one of the countrys largest predators. The woman was mauled by what witnesses believe was an adult black bear in a remote area of north-west Alberta, said police. A co-worker who witnessed the attack helped scare off the bear before calling for help. She was evacuated by her co-worker on a helicopter and brought back to the Swan Hills airport where they met up with an ambulance, emergency crews, and she was subsequently declared deceased at the airport, RCMP spokesperson Cpl Troy Savinkoff told the Canadian Press. The victims family has asked that she not be identified. Tree planters hired by private companies to re-forest swaths of the taiga after logging operations are often sent to work in remote, rugged terrain. Working long hours in the boreal forest, they often encounter wild animals, including cougars, wolves and bears. Despite a large population of black bears and a growing number of encounters between humans and bears in urban and wild environments, fatal attacks remain extremely rare in the province. Since 1958, only five other fatal black bear attacks have been reported in Alberta.

Officials have also taken samples from the victims clothing for analysis to create a DNA profile of the bear. So far, three adult black bears have been located in the area and officials are awaiting DNA results to confirm if one of them is responsible for the attack. If confirmed, officials are likely to kill the animal unless they can determine the attack was defensive.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"seek-the-new-world-of-work-\/2022\/jul\/25\/what-do-employees-expect-of-a-workplace-in-2022","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/seek-the-new-world-of-work-\/2022\/jul\/25\/what-do-employees-expect-of-a-workplace-in-2022","DATE":"2022-07-25 03:47:21","PLAIN_TEXT":"For many employees, the thought of returning to a physical workplace has been the light at the end of a two-year long tunnel. For others, feelings are a little more complex. A lot has changed since the start of the pandemic and employee expectations in the workplace are very different to what they once were.When it comes to returning to a physical location, employee perks that were once considered a nice to have have been pushed aside by a list of non-negotiables, replacing the ping pong tables and fruit bowls of the past. According to Seek, full-time employees are now driven by work-life balance almost as much as they are by salary and compensation. And when it comes to the organisations job seekers are drawn to, they value supportive and respectful companies above all else.But how do these desires translate in the office? Heres what employees really expect from their workplace in 2022. Flexibility when it comes to in-person days and hours In many industries, the days of working five days in a set location are long gone - and a majority of employees agree that its a good thing. According to Seeks Laws of Attraction research, 28% of full-time employees said that the ability to work from home is a must-have, while another 49% said theyd be delighted if it was offered. Good Mood Dudes create evidence-based health and wellbeing programs for employers to implement in workplaces. Founder Nick Chartes says that beyond the option to work remotely, employees should be given the option of deciding which days of the week theyre at home and which theyre in the workplace. In most businesses right now, its all about autonomy and flexibility: the autonomy to select how many days in which people are going into the office, as well as the flexibility to adjust that on a week by week basis, Chartes says. And its not just flexibility around days, but hours on site too. I think core hours are an antiquated concept, says psychologist and Seek ambassador Sabina Read. Before the pandemic, flexibility used to be primarily for the benefit of people who had children, but Ive long held the belief that you dont need to have kids to warrant flexibility. There are so many other parts of a humans life that are a valid reason for wanting flexible hours like exercise, caregiving, or pets. A workplace thats easy to get to and work in If employees are going to leave the comfort of their own home, it makes sense theyre hoping to spend time in a space thats just as, if not more, enjoyable to be in. Through the pandemic, many people got used to running errands and working out through the workday, and those desires are going to continue. Natural light, fresh air, and end-of-trip facilities - so people can ride into work or go to the gym at lunchtime - are now pretty much mandatory for a lot of companies, says Chartes. Being close to public transport, supermarkets, gyms, parks, and green space is also great. Seeks data tells the same story with 54% of full-time employees saying theyd be delighted if their workplace was easy to walk or cycle to. When it comes to the internal set-up of the work environment, Read says privacy is just as important as aesthetics. What many people really need in an office is privacy, whether its in meeting rooms or another space where they can get away to focus or take video calls. As hybrid work becomes the norm, physical spaces need to enable employees to connect with remote workers without disturbing their team. Practical perks that go beyond free coffee and snacks In the past, a free coffee may have been enough to entice employees to work each morning. But now? Not so much. Instead, employees are looking for benefits that will improve their worklife balance. Its not likely that someones going to choose a job or company based on the quality of muesli in the kitchen, Chartes says. Theres been a transition over the last four or five years, going from basic perks to things like increased parental leave, uncapped leave, time in lieu, and school holiday programmes for kids. In fact, according to Read, offering low-value perks can have the opposite to the desired effect on employees. Now, we need to think beyond free coffee and breakfast, fruit bowls, or even yoga classes, she says. It can undermine an employees value, or at least their perception of how valued they are, when the things being offered arent meaningful to them. Photograph: Westend61Getty Images Trust from their employer Benefits like flexible working hours and remote work require a certain level of trust between an employee and their manager. However, Read warns that this doesnt mean these perks should only be offered to long-term employees. Employers need to find other ways to cultivate trust without assuming that trust is born from longevity and many hours, or years, of face-to-face contact, she says. They need to trust that people want to work, to learn, to grow, and to see the fruits of their labour. And that needs to be the default until proven otherwise.

After the Guardian published secret camera footage showing Ann King being abused at the PS2,000-a-week Reigate Grange care home, the Care Quality Commission said on Friday it was reviewing this evidence and working with other stakeholders to determine whether regulatory or criminal enforcement action is required. The move came after Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, called for an urgent investigation into the home, which is operated by the luxury chain Signature Senior Lifestyle, calling the abuse by workers a total disgrace. Kate Terroni, the chief inspector of adult social care at the CQC, described the footage as devastating and appalling, adding: No one should be treated like this in their own home, and no family should have to witness their loved ones being treated this way. She urged any families who had concerns about standards at any care home to call the CQC hotline: 0300 0616161. King was the victim of common assault by a cleaner and treatment by other care workers that Signature admitted was reprehensible and the result of actions of a few rogue individuals. The footage was captured on a secret camera installed on her bedside table by her children, who had grown concerned about her wellbeing. Related: Abuse, no other word for it: a nurse analyses Reigate care home footage Signature said it had immediately informed all other residents and families that significant concerns had been identified at the home and encouraged them to report any concerns they may have to Surrey county councils safeguarding team. The care minister, Neil OBrien, said he was shocked and saddened by the abuse and mistreatment in this case and my sympathies are with the victim and her family. He said: Everyone receiving care deserves safe and effective support and to be treated with dignity and respect. Following the allegations the police, local authority and Care Quality Commission acted swiftly to investigate. This included a criminal investigation, inspections and continued monitoring to make sure this does not happen again. Kings case has resonated among families of people in other care homes with high fees, who have expressed their own concerns for the treatment of their loved ones and contacted the Guardian to express solidarity with King and her family. The chair of a commission on the future of social care convened by the archbishops of Canterbury and York said the extremely disturbing case shows the need to have more volunteers and visitors going into care homes to prevent abuse. Incidents of poor care are more likely to happen behind closed doors, said Anna Dixon. We need to be thinking about breaking down walls and making care homes much more embedded in the community with more volunteers and visitors going in and engaging with residents. The Peoples Care Watchdog, a families group campaigning for greater access to care homes, called for all care operators to allow families to install CCTV on a routine basis and said what had happened to King was not isolated. Signature Senior Lifestyle is ultimately owned by a PS150bn Canadian institutional pension fund investor and charges among the highest rates in the UK for luxury living, exceptional care. The company, which has apologised for the conduct of its staff and said these actions were committed by rogue individuals, has denied any suggestion its ownership model had any bearing on Kings experience and said its owners allowed it to invest in its care teams with higher-than-average staffing ratios, pay and annual leave. Related: Why global investors are piling into the UKs luxury care home sector Signature has said: We were shocked and appalled at the experience of Mrs King - and reiterate our apology to her and her family - but the behaviour of a small number of reprehensible individuals should not tarnish the reputations of a wider staff team that is routinely praised for their dedication to residents. Richard Last, Kings son, has been keen to emphasise that other workers in the home were caring. Reigate Grange is part of a growing sector of high-end care homes charging up to PS100,000 a year, backed by institutional investors and private equity firms. The CQC said it was determining whether regulatory or criminal action was required after first seeing the footage on Thursday. Signature said it had made CQC aware of the footage in May and engaged with them about it at length since then and so was surprised they have now U-turned on previous comments that they were reassured by our actions. A spokesperson said Signature has responded in the strongest way possible to these rogue individuals and we have an exceptionally robust safeguarding policy, which the CQC is said to have recognised in a May inspection report. We will continue to work with the CQC to answer any further questions they have and to reassure them as to how seriously we take our responsibility to keep residents safe, the spokesperson said. Lady Andrews, the chair of the House of Lords committee on social care, said she was shocked and dismayed by Kings treatment. It betrays the fundamental principles and values, the essential kindness and compassion, that she had the right to expect and that everyone should be able to count on in every care setting, she said. Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said anyone who treated an older person in a way that was dehumanising or denied them dignity and respect had no place in the care sector and should be dismissed, and when a criminal offence may have been committed the police should always be involved. Related: I will always hear her screams: family tell of heartbreak over care home abuse Streeting said: Providers who cannot keep their residents safe have no place in social care. Labour will force them out of the market. A country that supports people from cradle to grave needs a quality care service. The next Labour government will build a National Care Service to ensure good levels of care for all who need it. Helen Wildbore, the director of the Relatives &amp; Residents Association, said the experience of King and her family would chime chillingly with many families who have been ignored when trying to raise concerns about care. The system is stacked so heavily against people living in care and their families, she said. Time and again we hear of people being failed by the regulator. Abuse and toxic cultures thrive when there is little monitoring and accountability, by the management, by the owners, by the regulator and by safeguarding teams. How to choose a care home Ann Kings abuse at one of Britains most expensive care homes has left families wondering how best to choose a care home. Emma Williams, helpline officer at Relatives &amp; Residents Association, shared her guidance: Are you being sold spas and gyms your loved one cant use? How do visits work? Poor visiting policies appear linked to problems with care. Do all staff, including cleaners and cooks, have dementia training? How often does the home review care plans? It should be monthly. How well is the home connected with local community groups? Check Care Quality Commission reports and beware homes where the rating yo-yos. How does the home support hospital, GP and dentist appointments? Do the night staff have supervision on site? Beware reliance on emergency numbers.

So far, so standard for the capitals never-ending development and redevelopment. However, this block of flats is one of the first buildings being constructed at Rotherhithe, for Canada Water, a new London neighbourhood. The FTSE 100 London-focused property developer British Land has a master development agreement with the local council, Southwark, to deliver a new, mixed use town centre. The companys huge Canada Water project covers 21.4 hectares (53 acres). On completion in approximately 10-15 years up to 3,000 new homes will have been built, 35% of which are described as affordable, as well as shops and office buildings, with space for 20,000 workers, as well as a life sciences complex, a new municipal leisure centre and a repurposed cultural hub. We dont think theres anything of a scale as this [development] other than Kings Cross, says Emma Cariaga, the head of residential and the joint head of Canada Water at British Land. The first homes in a residential building, The Founding, have just gone on sale in the PS5.6bn regeneration scheme, which is a 50:50 joint venture between British Land and Australian pension fund Australian Super. British Lands The Founding at Canada Water will eventually be 35 storeys tall. Photograph: Joanna Partridge The core of the main tower currently stands at 20 storeys, but once it is completed and new residents can move in approximately 18 months time, the building will be 35 storeys tall and will contain 186 one-, two- and three-bed flats, all of which will have their own balcony. As well as marking the beginning, The Founding is also named in reference to the timber which arrived here by ship from North America - hence Canada Docks - from the late 1870s onwards, used during Londons construction boom. The former dock managers office has become a showroom for potential house buyers, where they visit full-size replicas of fashionably decorated one- and two-bed homes. A quarter of the flats in the first phase of the development are classed as affordable and available through social rent and shared ownership - where buyers buy a portion, such as 25% of a property, and pay rent on the rest - designed for first-time buyers with lower deposits. However, most of the flats for sale come with a considerable price tag: starting at PS700,000 for a one-bed, rising to just under PS1m for a two-bed and about PS2m for the few three-bedroom homes located on higher floors. Any prospective buyers will be required to pay a deposit of 10% to exchange contracts on the property, and the rest on completion once the building is finished. Meanwhile, across the whole Canada Water scheme, a quarter of the new homes built will be available for social rent, allocated by Southwark council, while a further 10% of rental homes are described as being of intermediate cost for people such as key workers. The Founding will have three roof terraces, but unlike many similar modern developments, will not boast a basement gym or swimming pool. Instead residents will be able to use the leisure centre being built right next door, which will be run by the council. British Land new Canada Water development - the pool Photograph: British Land British Land says this will help homeowners avoid the high service charges required to cover the running cost of such amenities. Nor will these be for exclusive use by homeowners, as is the case with the controversial Sky Pool, the swimming pool suspended 10 storeys above ground at the luxury Embassy Gardens residential development at Nine Elms in south-west London. There will, however, be a central water feature in the development as the current, uninspiring, Canada Dock will be significantly redesigned, through the addition of plants and wetlands for wildlife, and a curving red pedestrian bridge spanning the water. When dealing with new districts, the very nature of their scale and the fact that they mixed use makes them relevant, it makes them viable, says Phil Hobley, the head of London offices at the estate agent Knight Frank. They wouldnt be if they were only one sector, if it was just residential or just commercial. Knight Frank, which has been appointed to advise British Land on the offices part of the development, believes the project demonstrates the improvement in commercial real estate in London since the upheaval unleashed by Liz Trusss disastrous mini-budget last autumn. I think were seeing sentiment start to improve, he says. Perhaps at odds with the developments affordable homes provision, the new flats are being marketed for sale by the property adviser JLL on its Hong Kong website. British Land says The Founding has received high interest from domestic buyers. Photograph: Joanna Partridge While British Land anticipates some overseas demand in The Founding, Cariaga says the company has seen a surprisingly high interest from domestic buyers. The reality is lots of central London developments have been and always will be attractive to a global audience, she says. She doesnt believe the homes are at the price point of the capitals multimillion-pound properties favoured by the global elite for investing their wealth. British Land believes it has benefited from the schemes launch after the changes triggered by the pandemic, including the widespread adoption of more remote working, and residents new demands of their neighbourhoods, the so-called 15-minute city model, designed for people to be within walking distance of local shops, leisure and services. Weve got such a great opportunity here to respond to that, says Cariaga, rather than, assuming we had started this five years, having to try to retrofit it. This includes providing communal spaces in some residential buildings, allowing people to work from home without having to sit at a desk in their flat. One challenge for British Land is changing the perception of Canada Water, a central, but previously overlooked, part of the capital. Located next to east Londons Canary Wharf financial district, the new development has the river and two sizeable parks at its boundary. Currently, the area mostly consists mostly of low-rise housing and few amenities, although there are some large out-of-town-style retailers, which have huge surface car parks. We need to remind people where it is. Part of the job to do is to expose how well-connected it is, says Cariaga, listing the districts public transport links including a bus station, an overground station and the tube, which connects with the new Elizabeth line one stop away at Canary Wharf. Younger Londoners are clearly a target for British Land, which hopes future residents will be able to live, shop and eat out in the neighbourhood, and maybe even work there. But the developer says it has already received interest from older prospective buyers looking to downsize but remain in the city centre. Half of the Printworks nightclub, housed in the former Daily Mail and Evening Standard printing plant, is to become a cultural venue and half an office. Photograph: Peter SummersGetty Images The centrepiece of the new district will be the building currently known as the Printworks. The distinctive, boxy structure, formerly known as Harmsworth Quays, was once owned by the Daily Mail and housed the newspapers printing press, before its more recent rejuvenation into a 5,000 capacity night club and event space. The site will gain yet another lease of life once half of it is transformed into a cultural venue, where drama and dance performances can be held, while the other part will be turned into an office, intended to become a company headquarters. London has experienced its fair share of much-heralded new developments in recent years, not all of which have been successful. The PS1.7bn waterfront office development at Royal Albert Dock in east London by the Chinese developer ABP (Advanced Business Parks), approved by Boris Johnson during his time as mayor, stands uninhabited and only partially completed. British Land - the developer behind the Cheesegrater skyscraper in the City of London as well as the redevelopment of campuses across the capital including at Paddington and next to Liverpool Street station - is betting on Canada Water having an altogether more successful ending. * This article was amended on 2 March 2023 to clarify the number of affordable homes across the whole first phase of the development.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/nov\/14\/monitoring-software-working-from-home-staff","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/nov\/14\/monitoring-software-working-from-home-staff","DATE":"2021-11-14 07:00:27","PLAIN_TEXT":"A year ago, while still in the grips of the pandemic, workers at many businesses - small and large - were continuing to work from home mostly due to either government or corporate mandates. Now, as the pandemic (hopefully) recedes, many workers are coming back to work but my smartest clients have learned that, to attract and retain the best people, a work-from-home option needs to be on the table. During the pandemic we were scrambling just to keep things going. But now were implementing policies that many feel should have supervisory controls. And many business owners, large and small, are asking themselves a question: is it time to monitor what our people are actually doing when theyre not working in the office? To this I say: are you kidding me? Apparently not. In fact, a growing number of companies, as theyre implementing new work-from-home benefits, are also incorporating remote monitoring software to keep an eye on their employees behavior. A recent poll in the UK of more than 2,400 workers by the trade union Prospect found that almost one in three reported being monitored, up from a quarter of workers in April 2021. Not only that but the number of remote workers who said theyve been watched through an in-home camera has doubled during that period. Yes, you read that right: an in-home camera! Here in the US a study of 1,250 employers by Digital.com revealed that 60% were using monitoring software to track the productivity and activity of their work-from-home employees, citing reasons such as a better understanding how employees are spending time, confirming workers are working a full day and ensuring theyre not using work equipment for personal use. Meanwhile, demand for remote monitoring software is up more than 54% since the pandemic started, according to a site that tracks these things, and to meet that demand a proliferation of software companies have emerged offering work-from-home monitoring solutions. For example, theres Aware, a platform that analyzes employee behavior across messaging platforms like Slack, which raised a $60m third round of financing last month. Microsoft announced just this week that it was adding increased employee surveillance so that its Microsoft 365 platform can use machine learning to track employee actions. Up-and-coming providers like Activtrak, Kickidler, Workpuls and iMonitorSoft position themselves as workforce analytics platforms but are really just offering their corporate customers the capability of watching how their employees are using apps, the ability to take random screenshots triggered by an employees suspicious behavior, and to see their workers activities. Workpuls promises its customers that employees can be monitored without being noticed so that they can still get the information you need. Really? After years of employees demanding more flexibility, independence and mobility are we as employers going to respond by tracking those employees every movement while theyre not in the office? This is the exact opposite of trust. There could not be a worse way to manage your teams. There does not exist a more inferior message to send to your people. There are lots of advice columns - like this one - written to help employers get the most out of their employee monitoring software or to help them better track the activities of their employees working from home. Want my advice? Dont. Dont monitor your employees. Dont buy any of this software. Dont worry about what your employees are doing when theyre not in the office. And for Gods sake, dont install a camera in an employees home! Instead, worry about how your business is achieving its objectives, how your employees are meeting their goals set out by their supervisors, whether or not theyre doing this from home or from Mars. Who cares? Who cares what your employees are up to? Who has the time to waste monitoring this minutia? I couldnt even bear to spend an hour monitoring my kids activities on Facebook without feeling my IQ drop, so now Im going to look over the shoulder of grown men and women hired to do a job for me as if theyre in middle school? This is not how you treat your people. This is not how you trust your team.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/jan\/09\/working-from-home-inequality-pandemic-inequalities-uk","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/jan\/09\/working-from-home-inequality-pandemic-inequalities-uk","DATE":"2022-01-09 14:00:22","PLAIN_TEXT":"It was Omicron that did it. Up until early December, office workers in England seemed to be steadily returning to their desks. But once the new variant had arrived, a change that had been taking shape since the Covid crisis started suddenly felt irresistible. Back-to-the-office schedules were binned, more companies announced long-term plans for so-called hybrid employment split between homes and workplaces, and there it was: a quiet revolution, whose consequences will unfold over the next year and beyond. Home and hybrid working has been embraced by a long list of tech companies that includes Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Spotify and dozens more. Something similar seems to be happening in the financial sector. In the UK, 18m sq ft of office space has been vacated since the start of the pandemic. In the past year, in such places as Derby, Southampton and the London borough of Brent around 20% of offices have been taken out of use, and there are projections that between now and 2027, one in 10 British offices will no longer be needed. For all the governments wishful thinking about a looming return to pre-Covid normality, this looks like deep, era-defining change. Talk to people in trade unions, and you get a sense of a new frontier that demands urgent and careful attention. At the union Unite, for example, they are working on a detailed template for home working agreements, designed to minimise the risk of isolation, stress and depression and health and safety risks from working in an unsuitable environment. So far, though, any political debate about what is happening has reduced everything to yet another instalment of the culture wars. The right seems to see any move away from the traditional workplace as a mortal threat to both the economy and our moral wellbeing, while more liberal voices glimpse something almost utopian: liberation from the daily commute, increased productivity, more family time. What both sides tend to ignore are massive issues about inequality, what work actually involves, and the way that big companies too often try to offload responsibility and risk on to fragile individuals. For a start, only a minority of us are actually able to work from home (WFH). In April 2020, the Office for National Statistics put the figure at 46%, although the number varied wildly across the UK: 57% of Londoners said they were able to do at least some work at home, whereas the figure in the West Midlands was 35%. In that context, even if home working ushers some of those who do it into an idyll of autonomy and holistic living, it threatens to make the class divisions that the pandemic widened both permanent and huge. Other questions centre on the people who now do at least some of their work not far from where they sleep. If you live alone, WFH may well represent both a degree of freedom and a snatching-away of human interaction. For young people at the start of their working lives, not being in an office will probably entail two kinds of disadvantage: being cut adrift from the collective workplace experiences that allow people to find their professional feet, and not having the domestic space to do your job effectively. There is, needless to say, clear evidence of how traditional gender roles affect home working: in American research done by the management consultants McKinsey, 79% of men said they experienced positive work effectiveness at home, compared with only 37% of women. Whoever you are, moreover, there is a good chance that WFH will have increased your hours: research during the first global lockdown found that for 3 million remote workers around the world, the average working day had increased by 8.2%, or nearly 50 minutes. The American writers Charlie Warzel and Anne Helen Petersen recently published Out of Office, an exhaustive but very readable book about the upsides and drawbacks of working from home. Its central contention, partly based on their experience of leaving behind office jobs in New York and attempting a new life in Montana, is that working remotely can remove you from the wheel of constant productivity, as well as turning you into a better friend and partner. The big problem, as they see it, is that far too many employers have quickly built a model of home working on workplace cultures that emphasise long hours, the kind of camaraderie that quickly turns painful, and close monitoring of what people do. They cite the comedian Kevin Farzads observation that if an employer ever says, were like family here what they mean is theyre going to ruin you psychologically. Allow those attitudes into peoples domestic environment, and you risk the total collapse of work-life balance. To understand that point, forget any visions of high-powered people flitting between the city and country and hosting Zoom meetings in their summerhouses. Instead, think about call-centre work, which was being pushed into peoples homes long before the pandemic. Here, you see not just the connections to be drawn between home working and bogus self-employment, but a new world of remote worker surveillance. In March last year, the Guardian reported on the multinational call centre company Teleperformance, and software built around webcams in home-workers laptops. If the system detects no keyboard stroke and mouse click, it will show you as idle for that particular duration, and it will be reported to your supervisor, said one set of instructions. If you dont talk about power in the workplace, youre not going to get this right, says Andrew Pakes, a deputy general secretary of the white-collar union Prospect. From this basic point, everything follows. We fixate on home working, when we really should begin with flexibility: irrespective of where they work, the chance for people to start and finish at times of their choosing, carve out free time and ensure holidays complement the other aspects of their lives. Companies ought to pay much more attention to the needs of new recruits - pairing them with dedicated mentors, ensuring they have the option of spending all or most of their working hours in a workplace, allowing them to join a trade union. For all employees, there ought to be both an entitlement to collective representation, and the kind of right to disconnect - to not have to deal with emails, calls and messages outside working hours - that has been adopted in France, Italy and Spain, and is now tentatively supported - for public sector staff at least - by the SNP-led government in Edinburgh. Somewhere in all that might be the beginnings of home and hybrid working that could actually improve peoples lives. The danger of the weary, punch-drunk mood of early 2022 is that indifference and fatalism will set in, and we will end up sleepwalking into a post-pandemic reality that no one wants. Amid grief, disruption and huge changes to our everyday experiences, the future has arrived: not just of work, but all the other aspects of life that it touches.

They are part of a new trend in the flexible world of work: Thursday is the new Friday. Office-based staff are increasingly returning to their city centre desks, but only for part of the week. Many are opting to commute to their workplaces during the core midweek days - Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday - bookending the working week at home. The popularity of Thursday evening socialising with colleagues has not gone unnoticed by the bosses of hospitality businesses. In terms of pattern in the cities, Mondays tend to be quieter, Fridays tend to be quieter, Thursday very strong, Phil Urban, the chief executive of the pub and restaurant group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, said. While the suburban business is still doing well, people who would have had a meal or a pint near their home are doing it in London. The pub and restaurant group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, which includes the ONeills chain, says its city centre locations are gradually becoming busier. Photograph: May JamesReuters The companys city-centre locations - which include the ONeills and All Bar One chains - are getting gradually busier, Urban said, which he attributed to the slow but steady return of workers. It continues to strengthen, and that is partly the offices going back. I think offices will continue to go from three days to four days. I travel in and out [of London], and at my train station Im now struggling to park again. Its the first time I can say that in two years, he said. Covid-19 caused two years of stop-start restrictions for office-based companies and their employees, who were repeatedly told by the government to work from home, then urged to return to their desks. After the lifting of lockdown measures, many businesses announced perks to entice their workers back, including unlimited hot drinks, free breakfasts or company-branded merchandise. Despite these inducements, the return to the office has been a trickle rather than a flood. The number of passengers on the tube midweek remains at 70% of pre-Covid levels, according to Transport for London. However, Thursday is streaking ahead as the most popular day to work alongside colleagues, according to TfL figures. Almost 3m tube journeys were made on Thursday 12 May, the highest number since the pandemic began. Interactive The trickle rather than flood of people means the bakery chain Greggs, for example, is still reporting sales 10% below pre-Covid levels at its outlets in city centres as well as those near offices. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has called for more investment in the capitals public transport to bring office workers back to their commute. The sluggish return can be partly attributed to the success of remote working during the pandemic. Since the lifting of restrictions, many of the UKs largest office occupiers - including the accountancy firm Deloitte and its 20,000 UK employees, and most of the banking company NatWest Groups 64,000-strong workforce - have switched to a hybrid model, allowing staff to divide their time between their corporate building and another location. Interactive It increasingly looks as if hybrid working is here to stay. A quarter of workers (24%) were dividing their time between home and the office in May, according to the latest survey by the Office for National Statistics, up from 13% in early February. Workers reported that an improved work-life balance was the main benefit of working from home in some capacity, while about half of hybrid workers said they had fewer distractions at home, and a similar number said working from home improved their wellbeing. A tight jobs market, in which workers can pick and choose jobs, has given employees more leverage in this negotiation. Employers who offer hybrid working to their teams are also likely to benefit from improved output, according to Heejung Chung, professor of sociology and social policy at the University of Kent. We are increasingly seeing evidence where working from home will be helpful for productivity, she said, adding that workers especially valued the chance to ditch the commute at a time of rising costs. Not having to travel to an office every day saves workers money and time, which evidence shows they give back to their employers in productivity gains when working from home, she said. This newfound flexibility brings challenges for city centre businesses, from sandwich shops to dry cleaners Chung, the author of The Flexibility Paradox, a book on flexible working, believes some degree of remote working is here to stay. We will see businesses asking workers to come back in more often, but will the office five days a week be normal again? Absolutely not, she said. The genie is out of the bottle and its not going back in. Yet this new-found flexibility brings challenges for city centre businesses, from sandwich shops to dry cleaners, whose trade previously depended on a steady stream of office workers five days a week. That may partly explain recent political interventions in the working-from-home debate. Boris Johnson recently called for workers to return to the office, saying it made people more productive. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for efficiency, stoked criticism after leaving what were deemed to be passive-aggressive notes on the desks of civil servants who were not in the office when he visited. Ministerial requests notwithstanding, the office return appears to be accelerating, as workers attend more in-person meetings. UK office occupancy hit its highest level since the start of the pandemic in the week ending 13 May, according to the latest data from Remit Consulting, a management consultancy that specialises in property. The average weekly office occupancy rate reached almost 28% across the UK, and topped 29% in London that week, the highest recorded over the past year, according to data sourced from entry systems at office buildings in major cities. However, this means office occupancy remains at about half the average level seen before the pandemic. Once again, the busiest days of the week remain Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Remit found. Despite worries about what this means for the future of offices, leasing in London is booming, according to recent updates from the office owners Land Securities and British Land. We have had the best year for London leasing in 10 years, Simon Carter, the chief executive of British Land, said, adding that companies were on the lookout for office space with natural light and outside terraces, and were demanding sustainable, energy-efficient buildings. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Location is also important, Carter said: I think there has been a drive to more central locations, because if people are going to come into the office three, four days a week but live more dispersed around the UK, they want an office that is closer to a major transport hub. British Land has three campuses in London that comprise office buildings, surrounding shops and hospitality venues and account for two-thirds of its property portfolio. Even it concedes the post-pandemic world of work will differ from what came before. Our overall view is that London will need less space because of working from home, but it is going to need better space, Carter said. And that is what we are seeing in our leasing activity.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/jun\/12\/gloriously-gnarly-what-professional-botanists-plant-at-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/jun\/12\/gloriously-gnarly-what-professional-botanists-plant-at-home","DATE":"2022-06-11 20:00:28","PLAIN_TEXT":"Walking through Londons Kew Gardens on a winters day, the botanist Prof Tim Entwisle was struck by the sight of a Persian ironwood tree.

He also planted banksias, the red-flowered form of broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca viridiflora), and Senna magnifolia, a tropical dry-country species that carries incandescent yellow flowers for nine months of the year. What connects these plants are their sculptural forms - gloriously gnarly, Worboys says - and their appeal to birds and insects. In Sydney, Dr Cathy Offord, the principal research scientist and manager of the Australian PlantBank at the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan, also works with endangered species, including those collected by Worboys in far north Queensland. She is involved in conserving the Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis) and macadamia (Macadamia tetraphylla), which is vulnerable to extinction in the wild. In Offords own garden, I like to mix it up, she says. Alongside a dragon fruit (Selenicereus) scrambling up a tibouchina (Tibouchina), there are orchids, succulents and a bonsai collection that includes a native rhododendron - the species really lends itself to bonsai - and a Wollemi pine.

Since retiring from his position as curator manager at the Royal Botanic Garden Sydney, he has had more time to devote to his collection of tillandsias, a group of bromeliads also known as air plants.

It was Tillandsia usneoides - Spanish moss - but I didnt know what it was at the time. While studying botany at university, I started to collect them. Dixon has about 360 species. He follows a policy to ensure his collection develops in the right direction. Wherever possible, plants are accompanied with data about their place of origin and collector. Not all of the species have been described and given a scientific name, and provenance is vitally important to that process. Dixons garden is filled with palms and cycads for a tropical feel, and he selects other plants for their flowers and shape to add different texture. As senior curator at the Botanic Gardens of South Australias nursery, Matt Coulter works with a wide variety of species. But he is especially interested in the titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum). When a titan arum blooms, it makes the news. This rare species from the rainforests of Sumatra produces a three-metre flower spike wrapped in a dark purple collar. It also stinks of rotting meat to bring in its pollinators - blowflies and carrion beetles. Coulter has spent 14 years working on the cultivation of the titan arum and related species. He exchanges information with other experts around the world. A butterfly amaryllis (Hippeastrum papilio), an endangered species from Brazil that Matt Coulter works with.

His small garden is packed with heirloom crops and rare varieties. To maximise space, he grows his fruit trees as espaliers, pruned and tied to frames. I love plants and I love cooking, and I can bring those two things together at home. If I have any free time, Im in the garden.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2023\/jan\/15\/private-brokers-earn-millions-finding-care-homes-for-nhs-patients","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2023\/jan\/15\/private-brokers-earn-millions-finding-care-homes-for-nhs-patients","DATE":"2023-01-15 08:00:09","PLAIN_TEXT":"Private brokers are making millions of pounds a year finding care home beds for NHS patients who are fit to leave hospital. Agencies are being hired to provide discharge services, finding suitable places for elderly patients amid pressures on the health system, Observer analysis shows. Carehome Selection Ltd, the UKs biggest social care brokerage, has expanded in the past five years and now claims partnerships with 150 NHS organisations and local authorities, with revenues of PS20m, up about 75% compared with 2018. In 2021, the most senior director of its parent company was paid PS609,000, up from PS138,000 in 2020, according to its latest accounts. The agency is one of the biggest beneficiaries in a group of firms providing brokerage services, predominantly helping councils seeking places for patients stuck in hospitals. A chronic lack of social care capacity means up to one in three hospital beds in England are occupied by patients who are ready to leave, with the backlog contributing to record ambulance and treatment delays. Care home brokerages help identify suitable care home places so that medically fit patients can be discharged, freeing up capacity in overstretched wards. But such arrangements are usually made by the NHS and councils dealing directly with each other and local social care providers. Daisy Cooper MP, health spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said the reliance on agencies was a scandalous situation. The governments failure to plan has left local authorities with no choice but to turn to private brokers for even the most basic of functions, she said. Carehome Selection says its services save money and speed up discharges. Our service model includes evening and weekend working, so no time is lost, its website says. The company says it has close relationships with care providers, which pay a fee when a service user is referred. Patients and their families do not pay. Last week, the firm signed a three-month, PS223,000 contract with Leeds city council to provide brokerage services to find step down beds so people can leave hospital into care homes. In July, it began a PS243,000 contract with Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council to provide a brokerage service for self funders until March 2023. In County Durham, the company is being paid to assess patients and help match them with suitable care home places. That contract, signed in April, is worth up to PS1.95m over five years. Carehome Selection was founded by a GP in 1995 and started working with the NHS 20 years ago. It has scaled up operations since receiving a PS10m cash injection from investment firm BGF in 2018 and subsequently saw its revenue grow by 75% to more than PS20m, delivering a strong return for investors. In 2021, the company was acquired by private equity-backed Acacium, which also runs agencies supplying staff to the NHS and says it is the UKs largest healthcare solutions partner. During the pandemic, Acacium - part of the Onex Corporation, owned by Canadian billionaire Gerald Schwartz - was criticised for charging up to PS170 an hour for nurses, four times the approved framework rate. The firm said at the time that far from inflating fees during the pandemic, it had increased the availability of discounted rates, waived cancellation fees and capped travel costs to customers. Another NHS supplier offering discharge services said on its website that it helps return patients to their homes safely, avoiding unnecessary delays. Its service is for hospitals who are experiencing a large number of delayed transfers and councils facing delays due to capacity issues. NHS trusts and local authorities are also paying agencies to assess patients care needs, analysis shows, including those waiting to be discharged from hospital or entitled to funding due to complex long-term health problems. In one case, Leeds city council is outsourcing patient assessments to help it clear the backlog of referrals to hospital social work teams. The contract will see a consultancy firm assess 100 patients and is worth PS40,000. A spokesperson for the council said it was experiencing a significant shortage of social workers, which had affected hospital discharge teams. In order to continue to support timely discharges, the council has secured agency staff on a temporary basis and is also trialling a brokerage service which supports the admission of people into residential care, he said. The council said its initiatives were being funded using an allocation from a PS500m government fund announced in September to support hospital discharges. Local health and care organisations were told they could use the funding flexibly to tackle the areas facing the greatest challenges. Related: Hospitals in England discharging patients into care hotels Rory Deighton, director of the acute network at the NHS Confederation, said using private providers to help coordinate hospital discharges may not be appropriate in every case but could offer value for money and reduce backlogs. A spokesperson for Carehome Selection said it commits to and is paid based upon performance-based outcomes centred on accelerating speed of hospital discharge. They added that clients using the service had reduced the average time to discharge medically fit patients from 10 to three days. The Department of Health and Social Care said: The purpose of the PS500m discharge fund is to reduce the number of bed days lost to delayed discharge. It is for NHS trusts and local authorities to decide whether to access support from the private sector in improving flow through the health and social care system.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2021\/jun\/02\/remote-working-disabled-people-back-to-normal-disability-inclusion","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2021\/jun\/02\/remote-working-disabled-people-back-to-normal-disability-inclusion","DATE":"2021-06-02 08:00:35","PLAIN_TEXT":"Tables blocking the road. Chairs over flat kerbs. Gazebos built on accessible parking. The surge in street dining since lockdown eased in England has been great for businesses, but not so much for wheelchair users and people with mobility conditions, who report being unable to get around their home towns due to the new blockages. Many of these people have been stuck indoors for up to a year shielding, and on their first taste of freedom are now being blocked from getting to the shops or pub. All I want to do is go and meet my friends and have a pint, said Katie Pennick, a campaigner and wheelchair user, recently on BBC Radio 4. Its not your typical civil rights slogan but it characterises the crunch of so much disability politics: disabled people deserve the right to have a life like everyone else. This sort of thoughtless planning would be frustrating at any time, but it is all the more so as we come out of a period when disability inclusion was finally given attention. At the start of the first lockdown, I reported that society was opening up to millions of disabled and chronically ill people as virtual living became the norm - from Zoom job interviews and streamed gigs and theatre to NHS phone appointments. But just as it took the non-disabled public to experience a dose of what disabled people have for years before access was improved, the fear is that any gains made during the pandemic will be discarded now that the wider public no longer need them themselves. Related: Disabled people in UK threatened with sack unless they go back to work Take work for example. The shift to working at home over the past year brought new opportunities to those previously excluded from the workforce. As one woman with agoraphobia told me: Lockdown has opened my world - it allowed her to get a job from her front room. But as ministers and some employers push for a return to the office, many disabled workers are worried their hard-won progress will go backwards. A research scientist with endometriosis and IBS told me her employer has already stopped letting her work from home full-time, even though her job can be done remotely. The office is going back to normal and they dont want us at home even though I can do a better job [here], she said. The disability employment gap in the UK is vast - in 2020, the employment rate for disabled people was just 53.7%, compared with 82% for non-disabled people - and has been largely stagnant for years. Retaining flexible working is one way to address it. Such working patterns will help many others beyond disabled workers, from working parents to carers of elderly parents. Rather than being reduced in coming months, these schemes should be extended; a survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found that almost half of workers currently dont have flexible working arrangements such as flexitime, part-time hours or job shares. Or look at socialising. The Zoom pub quiz became a cliche of lockdown, but what many of us did informally with friends was also replicated by companies, with art exhibitions streaming online or bars running virtual club nights. As venues open back up, Im hearing from scores of disabled people losing out: from the parishioner whose churchs Zoom coffee morning allowed her to speak to people from her congregation for the first time in 15 years but which has now been stopped, to the person who went to an LGBTQ+ club night for the first time in their life when it went online during lockdown but has now watched it close. Related: Covid made politicians look at our miserly benefits. But is PS20 the best they can do? | Frances Ryan Too often, cultural prejudice around disability assumes disabled people dont need the same pleasures as everyone else, but health doesnt change who you are. As one music-loving young housebound woman shared on Twitter: Magically, over the past year Ive seen countless live gigs and the thought of that being taken away is devastating. It doesnt have to be this way. The Young Vic theatre in London announced in May that it plans to livestream all of its future productions, and gym companies say online workouts are here to stay, despite the popular return of in person classes. This doesnt mean good access is about moving everything online: many disabled people want face-to-face settings, and besides, the surge in virtual experiences shouldnt let businesses off the hook from adapting physical spaces which are still too often inaccessible. It simply means that it is right to keep the option, and that we need a culture in which companies think about disabled people - and our cash - as valuable. As we rightly celebrate a return to normal, it should be remembered that, for disabled people, normal too often means being excluded from everyday life. Anyone who has felt the pang of missing nights with mates in the pub over the past year can empathise and support disabled people being restricted and isolated now. If you spot a restaurant blocking a wheelchair entrance, tweet a photo and tag your local council. If your employer is rolling back flexible working rights, talk to your union (or join one). Attempts to gain access for disabled people are often met with pushback: its too much trouble, too expensive or simply unnecessary. And yet lockdown showed that sweeping changes can be made practically overnight with little fuss. The question is, if it was done for non-disabled people then, why not disabled people now?

With some families unable to afford the cost of boiling potatoes, even people on middle incomes could struggle to pay the predicted PS285 per month that a combined gas and electricity bill could cost from October. Last winter the average monthly bill was PS106.* Handing out money for gas bills - the governments current policy - is a short-term solution, but with prices unlikely to come down in the next few years there are much better ways the government could use the money. Cheaper than subsidising gas? Not using it at all. Thats where insulation comes in. We take a spin through the average British house to look at how heat leaks and how insulation can save money - and slash Britains carbon emissions. default Insulation projects have plummeted since 2012 In addition to putting pressure on family budgets, burning gas and oil to heat homes causes 16% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions, according to figures from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy. Insulation would help with both of these problems. But insulation projects have plummeted in the UK in the last 10 years. Stacked bar chart showing the fall in insulation projects in Britain since 2012 David Camerons 2013-15 green deal policy to increase insulation had no money behind it. The green homes grant scheme was introduced in 2020, but the administration - contracted out to a US consultancy, was botched, according to Juliet Phillips of climate thinktank E3G. So despite huge interest, hardly anyone has been able to get vouchers. Cameron also scrapped more rigorous standards for insulation and energy efficiency in new homes due to come into force in 2016, meaning that at least 1.5m homes have been built to standards that are inadequate for the countrys 2035 goals and will need to be retrofitted. And retrofitting comes at a much higher cost than building in energy efficiency from the start. This constant change has damaged the insulation industry. There has been this boom-bust policy making which has really decimated the industry, says Phillips. The government has ambitious climate plans - for example, phasing out all gas boilers in homes with electricity-powered heat pumps by the late 2030s. If the electricity generation is green, then the technology is there for British homes could be net zero by 2035. But heat pumps wont work well unless the houses are properly insulated. And with no replacement policies or cash, that leaves many of Britains homes without simple insulation - unnecessarily cold, expensive to heat and pumping out carbon emissions. Heres the scale of the challenge ahead: default How could it work? Theres no silver bullet, says Phillips. There is such a diverse range of houses and households - from families living on the breadline in fuel poverty, through to people who are well-off. Her thinktank, E3G, suggests a range of measures, from refitting all social housing and poorer owner-occupied houses through to green mortgages and stamp duty holidays for those at the wealthier end of the spectrum. Other ideas include devolving the power and funding to local councils, an approach recommended by the Climate Change Committee. with clear goals to insulate a certain number of homes by a certain date. Going street by street and making it easier to opt-in rather than to opt out could all incentivise takeup. Although recent Conservative governments dont have a good track record of working with local authorities on these issues. And then there are the the people needed to do the work: fitting solid wall insulation, maintaining heat pumps, fitting solar panels, and building new buildings to level A energy-efficiency specifications. And thats an opportunity as well as a problem, says Phillips. We need to think about skills and supply chains and how we get the industry doing a lot of more retrofits than it already is. Were calling for an Olympic-style employment and skills taskforce - we should be doing the same right now for energy efficiency to train up those workers. Note on the data *The October price cap will be announced by Ofgem in August, and will set the price of energy bills for most people - those on price-capped standard tariffs from 1 October to 31 December 2022. In May Ofgem predicted the price cap would be PS2,800 annually (PS232 monthly) for a household with medium energy consumption - defined as using 12,000 kWh of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity per year. Currently it is PS1971 annually - PS164.25 a month. Management consultants BFY suggested in July that the price cap could be as high as PS3,420 from October - PS285 a month - due to Russias decision to cut gas supplies to Europe. * This article was amended on 1 August 2022 to correct instances where figures originally given in millimetres had been out by a factor of 10 when converted to centimetres.

They have a fierce urge to do something to help. Recent polling shows that the public believes the UK government should be doing more to welcome Ukrainian refugees. Its clear our country has been moved and wants to help those whose lives have been turned upside down by the conflict. The government is now attempting to harness this wave of compassion and sympathy with its homes for Ukraine scheme. On the face of it, the plan is bold and ambitious. Any person who wants to take a Ukrainian refugee into their home will be able to do so as long as they can name them and they have a visa. The echoes of David Camerons big society are impossible to miss. The scheme certainly has great potential to bring people face to face with the experience of refugees and support them. Its already happening in Poland, Germany and other countries in Europe where Ukrainians dont need visas to enter and are being granted permission to stay for up to three years with full rights and entitlements. The public welcoming refugees into their homes in this way and on this scale feels unprecedented. However, in one area the UKs approach remains far more restrictive than that of our neighbours: the insistence on visas. The government is relying on what is effectively a managed migration route to respond to a humanitarian crisis. This inevitably means paperwork and bureaucracy are being put before peoples urgent needs. Imagine a child who has been separated from their mother and father having to navigate a visa application to reach safety in the UK. Despite the failure to waive the visa requirements, some Ukrainians will be able to get to the UK under the new scheme. Ensuring their safety and wellbeing when they arrive will be vital. Even with the best of intentions on all sides, there are potentially many things that could go wrong which need to be addressed in advance. Sponsors may not always be sensitive or reasonable in their expectations - we all know stories about flat shares, housemates or landlords that dont work out. Living with someone youve only just met can be difficult for both sides, for all the joy it can also bring. There are also risks that refugees will end up in inappropriate or at worst exploitative conditions. Related: Thinking about offering a room to a Ukrainian refugee? Let me help | Helen Pidd The government has said that those offering accommodation will be vetted, and its imperative appropriate checks are put in place. At the Refugee Council, we are particularly concerned that people coming here who have already had their lives shattered will not have access to housing benefits. If the relationship with the sponsor breaks down and they are unable to pay for private rented accommodation without welfare support there is a real risk they could end up homeless, which would be devastating. Allowing them to access housing benefit would also give them the opportunity to move into their own home if they choose to in the longer term. I understand there are some Ukrainians who have arrived already and who are keen to do this. If the government is refusing to facilitate this, there must be an alternative safety net so no Ukrainian ends up sleeping on the streets. The women and children arriving from Ukraine will also have specific needs given the traumatic experiences they have been through. They should all be given an initial health check and be able to register with a GP. Children will need to get into schools or childcare as quickly as possible too. So the government needs to ensure that doctors, schools, mental health and counselling services have the resources to respond to these needs. There must be a standard public service offer to any Ukrainian regardless of where they are housed in the country, and access to a specialist support worker. The programme should certainly not be delivered on the cheap. We should also not forget the needs of refugee communities already in this country. Many refugees from Afghanistan are still stuck in hotels without longer-term accommodation. There are also about 25,000 people in the asylum system having to cope in basic, sometimes very cramped, hotel rooms. While our attention is understandably on the plight of Ukrainians lets not ignore the fact that the asylum system needs to be properly resourced so that claims can be resolved more quickly and people can be housed in accommodation that meets their needs. At present a Ukrainian arriving through the asylum system could have to wait months and months to be granted permission to stay. It is also deeply ironic that at this time when the public so badly want to show their support to refugees from Ukraine, there is legislation before parliament that seeks to criminalise and repel any refugee who reaches our shores. The governments nationality and borders bill is a cruel and misguided attack on refugee rights. Now more than ever is the time to strengthen our commitment to welcoming refugees from all parts of the world, not seeking to slam our door in their face. The outpouring of public support is remarkable. The challenge now is to harness it in the best possible way, ensure all Ukrainians have a genuinely warm, safe and secure welcome, and use this moment to rethink our approach as a country to all refugees, to strengthen our commitment to refugee rights rather than weaken it.

A patterned seat, a colourful seat... the interior is an alchemy of antique and modern pieces that are as much to do with comfort and practicality as they are to do with aesthetic appeal. When Simon Rayner and his husband, Jeremy Langmead, moved into their 17th-century farmhouse in late 2019, they both had ideas about what they wanted. Simon was after a house with a long driveway that couldnt be viewed from the road (it can, but barely). When the garden gates open, there is a feeling of stepping into a private world. Jeremys craving was to create a cosy rural retreat. Previously they lived in a big-roomed Georgian house in Suffolk and the couple wanted to embrace a more kicked-back, country-cottage lifestyle - and this Grade II-listed whitewashed property hit all the right notes for them. Do we remodel? Do we move the kitchen down to the far room? says Simon of the thought process when they first moved in. Because of lockdown, we knew we were never going to be able to do the building work, so we settled on using furnishings and furniture to make the house feel like home instead. Kitchen confidential: Simon Rayner sits at the table in the cosy kitchen on a fleece from the Living Rug Company. Photograph: Claire Bingham Simon, a PR-turned-hospitality entrepreneur, never thought he would move back to his home county in the Lake District (where his family founded the kitchenware business Lakeland), but a pub changed his mind. Alongside business partner Andrew Black, a former publisher at Wallpaper* magazine, Simon renovated the Hare &amp; Hounds Inn near Windermere, a 17th-century pub with rooms. Here, the style of decorating features the same confident use of pattern and paint that counterbalance the antique wooden furniture. The result is an inviting, homely atmosphere that is modern yet unstuffy. Similarly at home, furniture may be vintage, but its far from twee. Theres not a hint of French shabby chic. In its place, there is a Swedish twist - cue the painted Gustavian cabinets that the couple have collected over years. Throw in a touch of Tangier with the Moorish ottoman in the living room (found on eBay) through to the striped ticking fabrics that are used as door curtains or sofa throws all over the house, and you have a decorating masterclass on learning to layer. For instance, take the cosy sitting room in the oldest part of the house. In this room, hand-dyed yellow linen blinds are paired with silk ikat lampshades, and a chair is upholstered in red linen from Pierre Frey with blue piping. These are all by textile designer and interior decorator Susan Deliss, who had a hand in many of the textile goings-on. The ottoman is from Robert Kime and the striped jute log basket is from Maison Bengal. Other than the tiny dining room, which is painted in Farrow &amp; Balls India Yellow, neutral walls are the foundation. If you took away the patterns, the rugs and the paintings, the decoration is plain underneath, Simon explains. I think were moving away from bold-coloured rooms where the furniture is almost a secondary thought. Objects are cleverly grouped. An expression of their stylish selves, a statement piece, such as the green dresser from Framlingham antique dealer Dix-Sept in the kitchen was the starting point, with accessories in a multitude of prints and supporting colours, bringing the whole room together in a lively mix. Layers of pattern: a Moorish table creates a focal point in the drawing room. Photograph: Claire Bingham We didnt want the units to be all the same colour, Simon says of the introduction of red and blue to the palette, which took more than 40 tester pots to get right. The red in the kitchen makes it feel warm in winter, whereas the blue adds freshness during the summer. The cream-coloured walls hold everything in place. Walk into the expansive, light-filled drawing room at the opposite end of the house and there is a shift in mood - less snug farmhouse, more elegant country house. Patterns work in harmony, with jewel-toned pinks and blues a recurring colour pairing and the walls painted a sandy brown - Chocolate by Edward Bulmer Natural Paint.

Under the new laws, employers will now face sanctions if they text message, phone or email their workers when they are off the clock. For us, this is as an essential move to strengthen the boundaries needed for a good work-life balance. There should be a boundary between the time when an employers authority prevails, and the time when the workers autonomy should prevail. There should be a boundary between the time in which a worker is a resource in the service of the person paying their salary, and the time in which they should be the owner of a life that is not all about work. We have introduced these new labour laws to avoid the blurring of the boundary between the time we spend serving others and family time. The boundary between time as a commodity with a financial value, and the precious time remaining for the enjoyment of life. In the age of the industrial revolution, workers could be little more than workers. The demand for shorter working hours was a central tenet of the labour movement from the very beginning. It was a demand that sought a way out of the extreme fatigue caused by long working hours, and the poor health caused by overwork. This alone would have been more than enough of a reason. But the demand for shorter working hours was also about establishing that workers should be more than just a labour force, that they should also be people de facto, and not just de jure. The worry has been that the rise of remote working is threatening to take us back to that period before trade unions won protections for their members, when the working day stretched out endlessly. Remote working has to be a step forward, not a step back. When more and more of us are working remotely, it is all the more essential to establish clear boundaries between working time and personal time. The ongoing digital transition made the need to legislate remote working necessary. The pandemic has made it urgent. We conceived this new legislation before the pandemic began, but it has become even more necessary now: to respond to the perverse, undesirable effects of the rapid expansion of tele-working. The necessity of all kinds of digital software means surveillance of workers has also grown very rapidly. Remote working has great advantages, but like all new phenomena that develop very quickly, carries new risks. Risks, above all, for the weakest part of the labour relationship: the workers. Labour market regulation cannot ignore the innate inequality between the parties: employers and employees. A work relation is not one between equals that can be freely regulated by the individual contract. In passing these new labour laws, we kept in mind the words of the 19th-century French preacher and writer Henri Dominique Lacordaire: Between the strong and the weak, between the rich and the poor, between the lord and the slave, it is freedom which oppresses and the law which sets free. Between the weak and the strong, the state must intervene to redress the balance. In an unequal relationship such as that between boss and worker, it is not enough to establish the latter has a right to disconnect; to switch off their mobile phone, close their laptop, or ignore phone calls that arrive in the middle of dinner with their family. Any abuse that conflicts with that right must be deterred through sanctions. This is why we have prohibited employers from contacting workers outside working hours, and imposed potential fines for breaking the rules. In practice, the right to disconnect has to be reinforced with that prohibition. We can always weaken new labour laws by invoking the difficulty of enforcing them whenever employment is precarious and wages are low - but we shouldnt. If the labour market makes it difficult to apply new laws, then we have to insist on reforming the labour market, not give up on regulating it. The law that we have just passed honours the legacy of the Portuguese Socialist party, in all those previous battles for workers rights. It is not in fact a radical law, but one that helps us take another step towards the development of Portugal as a more decent and egalitarian society.

This wasnt your average commute, though: the man was walking between his bedroom and his home office when he fell on the spiral staircase between the two rooms. Against the protestations of his companys insurer, Germanys federal social court ruled last week that the journey, less than a minute and inside the mans own home, counted as a workplace accident. Although the accident took place before the pandemic, the verdict comes at just the right moment: it feels like the latest brick removed from the wall that separates the home from the workplace. Last week Boris Johnson announced yet another return to home working in England, where possible. Just as many businesses had finally got their heads around hybrid working, or indeed had mandated a full return for workers, a large proportion of the country has now had to turn around again. Perhaps you have fallen back into the smothering embrace of your dressing gown; flopped the grubby mouse mat back on the kitchen table; resisted the temptation to work from a fully horizontal position in bed rather than pay for extra daytime heating; gone back to having to stand in front of the bathroom mirror breathing deeply for several minutes at a time and reminding yourself it is not a moral failure that your partner keeps putting her teaspoons in the sink instead of in the dishwasher, and you can absolutely get past this enraging and thoughtless thing and that it doesnt matter that she uses all seven of them every day, which means you have to wash one individually each time you want to make a hot drink, and that you love her and this is your life that you chose and you like it, you like it, you like it. The very earliest, sort-of-exciting days of working from home seem unimaginably long ago now. Im always at home! quickly became something more like Im always at work! or even, Im not really anywhere, I increasingly consider myself a mere flesh vessel for a consciousness that exists on Slack! And now here we are yet again, back at home working, back at what feels uncomfortably like square one or, more and more, like an interminable game of Whac-A-Mole in which, as soon as we are allowed to poke our heads above ground, we get unceremoniously thumped back inside. After almost two years, nobody has the energy for more discussion about whether working from home is good or bad. Everyone except Tory MPs whose friends own office buildings and power-drunk bosses would now accept that working from home is both good and bad. But what is noticeable, and different, is the feeling in the air that has accompanied the recommendations this time around. Whereas previous WFH mandates, socialising restrictions and even full lockdowns have felt like temporary measures in our effort to work towards something closer to pre-Covid normality, this time, since most people have had the all-important vaccines, the prevailing mood is one of a dull realisation that this may just be how we live now. Covid briefings are back, as are the war and natural disaster metaphors, the scrabbling for tests and booster appointments, the dark talk of a January lockdown. When I hugged my friends goodbye after lunch on Sunday we hugged a little longer, unsure when we may see each other again. And this unease feels like just one stage of a cycle we are dismayingly familiar with, the part where restrictions are creeping back and every day feels slightly worse than the one before. Related: Boris Johnsons crises boil down to one thing: contempt for the rest of us | John Harris When I asked people I know how they felt about leaving the office and going back to working from home, some of them were glad. They enjoy the short commute, more time with their partners, a later alarm in the morning. And some of them were not glad, annoyed by their lack of a home office, lack of routine, lack of connection-making opportunities with colleagues. The old satisfactions, the old complaints. But almost everyone this time around also expressed resignation to the grinding, repetitive inevitability of it. I once read that when explorers trek over the Ross ice shelf in Antarctica, the vast emptiness of the landscape means the next range of mountains looks so close it seems that the travellers could reach it any moment, whereas in fact they are several hundred miles away. I have often thought about this over the past two years, in the moments when everything seemed ready to get better and then didnt and the temptation was simply to lie down and die on the tundra rather than face another five months of your housemates rancid little experiments in lunch. And then I have tried not to think about it. Trying not to think about it too much is probably the only sanity-preserving way to deal with the merry-go-round of Covid restrictions at the moment.

The company, one of Frances biggest tech businesses valued at EUR1.1bn (PS920m) on the Paris stock exchange, sent a newsletter on Friday to its partners in Russia, including record labels and artists, updating them on its operations in the region. The update, which the Guardian has reviewed in both the original Russian and an English translation, assures its partners that it continues to operate and will continue to make scheduled payments, except to those whose accounts are with banks that have imposed sanctions. The letter then goes on to offer solutions to legally circumvent the banking ban by advising opening a new account with a restriction-free bank and then linking it to Believe. Believes UK operation lists La Roux as one of the acts on its books. Photograph: David Wolff-PatrickRedferns The translation says the company will continue to promptly adapt our solutions in accordance with ongoing changes. The position adopted by Believe, which serves artists and independent music labels around the world to build popularity via social media and put their work on streaming platforms such as Apple Music, is in stark contrast to leading players in the music industry. The worlds biggest record companies - Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music - have suspended or closed their operations in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, as have the streaming services Spotify, YouTube, Deezer and TikTok. Believe has almost 1,500 staff working in 50 countries and claims to provide artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) and management services to 850,000 acts worldwide. Its UK operation lists La Roux, the singer of hits including Bulletproof whose real name is Elly Jackson, Girli, Fumez the Engineer and The Plug as acts on its books. Believe was founded in 2005 and floated on Euronext last year, making it the first flotation of a tech company in Paris since 2014. Late last year, Believe made management appointments to strengthen its business in Russia and eastern Europe, where it is estimated to make about 10% of global revenues. Russia and eastern Europe have long been high priorities for Believe as the company was the first international music company to establish a presence in the region in 2013, the company said late last year. As of November, Believe said it had a team of 50 in Russia and was also active in 15 eastern European territories, with a team of 25, and had more than 1,000 clients in the region. They are a public company and they are watching every other business - including the music industry - suspend or shut operations because of what is happening in Ukraine, said one music industry executive. Believe has gone in the opposite direction and is not just promoting that they are still in the marketplace but are also actively working to show partners how to get around sanctions. Bjork has worked with Believe via the Allpoints France label. Photograph: Santiago FelipeGetty Images for ABA The company owns brands including New York-based music distribution platform TuneCore and in 2018 bought a controlling stake in Germanys Nuclear Blast, one of the biggest labels in rock and metal music that is home to acts including Slayer, Sepultura and Machinehead. Other music labels listed on Believes brands page include: Allpoints France, which has worked with Bjork; AFM records, which has Anvil and Lordi on its roster; and Naive, home to French acts M83 and Youssou NDour. Earlier this month, Bjork tweeted to her almost 800,000 followers that she was cancelling a show in Moscow after the invasion. Companies and artists who work with Believe outside Russia were not party to the memo and are not connected with its stance on continuing operations and payments in the country. David Bianchi, global chief executive of Various Artists Management, which represents La Roux and other artists that have worked with Believe, said: We were unaware of this situation and are holding urgent talks with Believe to ascertain all the facts in this matter. Various Artists and the artists we represent stand in full solidarity with Ukraine. We will not be undertaking any commercial or cultural activities that involve Russia or with companies and individuals who are connected to Russia moving forward. Bianchi said that he had asked Believe UK to remove all marketing and promotional imagery relating to La Roux from its website. On Monday, Believe moved to clarify its position, saying that it has stopped hiring and new investment in Russia and has suspended activities including releasing music from independent artists that use its services, as well as terminating relationships with local labels and artists it works with directly. No different from other international music companies, Believe is continuing to fulfil its agreed-upon obligations to our people, our artists and labels, including its payment obligations to Russian labels in full compliance with international sanctions, a spokesperson said. Our priority has been and remains to ensure the safety of our team members, artists and labels and that of families in the region, fully comply with international sanctions and support humanitarian efforts for Ukrainian refugees. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Believe said it has made a donation to the UN refugee agency, ensured that its Ukrainian staff, their families and artists and the labels it works with are safe and supported, and raised awareness and financial support for the country through the promotion of playlists of Ukrainian artists internationally. * This article was amended on 14 March 2022.

Or have rumours of its death been greatly exaggerated? The pandemic has already spawned a million think pieces on the subject. Now that Boris Johnson has dropped work-from-home guidance and some big companies are starting to tell staff to come back in, brace yourself for a gazillion more. If you dont have time to navigate the debate, heres a handy summary: the future of work looks very different depending on who you ask. People who have spent the pandemic Zooming from spacious holiday homes, and those with a financial stake in remote work, seem to be adamant that the days of trudging to an office are over. People with a financial stake in commercial real estate and ancillary industries, meanwhile, have been working overtime extolling the virtues of in-person work. One big proponent of the offices are for ever crowd is an architect called Clive Wilkinson who (this will shock you) designs office spaces. Not just any office spaces, mind you: Wilkinson is the guy responsible for Googles fancy headquarters in California. Hes got some regrets about the Googleplex now: in a recent interview with NPR, Wilkinson admitted that too many on-site perks can be dangerous because employees never have any reason to leave the office. Still, Wilkinson said the office may need to be reimagined but that doesnt mean its dead. The office is the fermenting ground for people growing into successful adults, he opined. How would that ever be dead? Im not going to answer that. Im just going to say his thoughts on the matter may have fermented a little too long. Meanwhile, on the other extreme of the debate, is Brian Chesky, Airbnbs CEO and a man who clearly hasnt spent the last two years quietly weeping as he tries to get work done while living in a one-bedroom flat with a very loud baby, a hyperactive dog and another adult who is also trying to get work done. (Im not projecting here; not projecting at all.) Last week Chesky announced that he will be working remotely as he hops from Airbnb to Airbnb around the world. Why? Well, because hes a billionaire and he can. And also, as he explained on Twitter, because he reckons this is the future: remote work has untethered many people (obviously not everyone, but a large chunk) from the need to be in an office every day. Per Chesky, that means more people will start living abroad ... and [becoming] digital nomads. Which, of course, is great news for Airbnb. Airbnb-hopping as you work from the beach sounds lovely, right? But lets remember that the people who can do this may be a lucrative customer base for Airbnb but cant, by any means, be described as a large chunk of the population. Its important to stress that point because it can be easy for those of us who have been lucky enough to work remotely during the pandemic to overestimate how many people have had the same opportunity. Last September, the Atlantic commissioned a poll asking Americans to estimate how many people had worked from home during the pandemic. Seventy-three per cent of the respondents who had worked remotely guessed at least half of Americans had done the same. In reality, the number of Americans who worked remotely was only 35% at its highest point (May 2020). Only 13.4% were working from home by the end of last summer. The numbers seem to be higher in Britain (47% of people worked from home in April 2020) but were still not talking about an overwhelming majority here. And this, really, is the key issue when it comes to the whole remote v in-person work conversation. Far too much airtime is given to the experiences of a relatively small proportion of the population; every other type of worker seems to be invisible. There may be a lot of grand ideas about the future of work floating around, but theres nothing futuristic about fixating on how to improve the lives of white-collar workers while ignoring everyone else. Thats just business as usual. * Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/aug\/20\/office-politics-firms-still-grappling-with-home-working-puzzle","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/aug\/20\/office-politics-firms-still-grappling-with-home-working-puzzle","DATE":"2021-08-20 13:00:35","PLAIN_TEXT":"As the pandemic struck wealthy economies in early 2020, workers (in white-collar jobs, at least) found themselves carrying out their duties from home. Now that vaccination programmes are continuing apace, more companies are grappling with how - and whether - to end the great enforced experiment in home working. The answer is far from settled, with Apple telling its global workforce on Friday that they will not return to its corporate offices until January at the earliest, amid concern over the spread of new coronavirus variants. The tech companys original plan to bring staff back in on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays in a hybrid home-working pattern had already been delayed from early September to October. Apple is far from alone in delaying the return, with health concerns unsurprisingly emerging as the governing factor. The UK government removed all guidance for people to work from home where possible on 19 July, but with infections remaining high, many companies have yet to bring all their workers back to the office. In the US, prominent tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Lyft, Wall Streets Wells Fargo and BlackRock are among those who this month delayed their return to the office until 2022 as cases of the more infectious Delta variant rise. Yet many other US businesses have carried on as normal for months. Even within some companies there are inconsistencies: some Facebook contractors have complained that they have been forced back to offices even as permanent employees stay at home. When businesses do return, one of the most significant frictions is proving to be vaccination status. The 2.1 million employees in US central government offices must now disclose their vaccination status on forms brought in this month. Joe Biden personally announced that those who have not been jabbed will be made to wear masks and socially distance from colleagues, making their personal decisions very publicly visible. The governor of Montana, Greg Gianforte, receives his first Covid jab. In his state, requiring vaccines as a condition for employment is deemed discrimination. Photograph: Thom BridgeAP However, individual states are taking wildly different approaches, reflecting political divisions. Democrat-controlled California last week mandated all teachers be vaccinated or be subjected to weekly testing. By contrast, Republican-dominated Florida, Texas, and Montana have all tried to ban vaccination mandates, with varying levels of success. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, who himself caught Covid-19 this week, has appealed to the states supreme court after lower courts ruled against his ban on government entities or private companies that receive state funds requiring the wearing of masks or proof of vaccination. Yet many American companies are taking a harder line on employees being inoculated than elsewhere in the world, in part due to federal guidance, updated in May, that explicitly allows employers to demand it. Unvaccinated staff are banned from buildings of the investment banks Citigroup, Jefferies and Morgan Stanley, while at JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank they must take regular Covid-19 tests. The aviation industry is among the keenest to exude an aura of Covid safety: Australias Qantas and Hong Kongs Cathay Pacific have both mandated vaccines for some staff. In Europe, some employment lawyers believe vaccine mandates from individual employers are unlikely to be legal, although the UK and France have brought in vaccine requirements for care and healthcare workers. I genuinely think this is a once-in-several-generations opportunity Peter Cheese France, Italy and Germany have all introduced controversial passes, which show vaccination or test status, that are required for entry to venues such as restaurants, cafes and cinemas. In Bordeaux, a trial is under way in tourist areas to issue bracelets for the vaccinated, so they can easily demonstrate their status to enter bars and restaurants. Some French employees will have to show their pass at work, as will Italian teachers. For all the efforts to bring workers back safely, the longest battle may be over staff who want to continue working from home at least some of the time. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has repeatedly said that working from home is damaging to younger workers prospects. The vacuum cleaner tycoon Sir James Dyson this week cast the return to the office as essential to the British economys competitiveness. He wrote in the Telegraph that Boris Johnson should restore companies right to determine where employees work - however unpopular. Yet there are convincing signs that the pandemic has prompted a permanent shift to home or hybrid working. A survey of 120 British companies shared with the Guardian by the insurance broker Willis Towers Watson suggests 41% of employers expect to use hybrid working in two years time, compared with 10% two years ago. In the US, a May survey of 500 top executives by McKinsey found that 48% expected workers to spend only two or three days in the office a week, compared with 8% before the pandemic. Related: Im being asked to go back to the office, what are my rights? Some employers are also enthusiastic, spying an opportunity to cut costs. In the UK an anonymous cabinet minister told the Daily Mail that civil servants should be forced to take pay cuts if they work from home. Removing the London weighting - extra pay to cover the higher costs in the capital - was one mooted option. However, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, called the comments unhelpful and employment lawyers were quick to point out that UK employers would almost certainly face cases for constructive dismissal if they tried to unilaterally cut pay set in a contract. Melanie Stancliffe, an employment law partner at Cripps Pemberton Greenish, said she had not seen any employers trying to cut pay so far, even among those thinking about lowering costs. Peter Cheese, the chief executive of the UKs Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, suggested that employers should embrace new ways of working. Companies have the chance to shift their very traditional paradigms of work, while at the same time making themselves more attractive to potential employees, he said. I genuinely think this is a once-in-several-generations opportunity to change working practices that havent changed since the industrial era.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2021\/may\/07\/chip-off-the-old-blocks-would-australias-empty-office-towers-be-better-off-as-housing","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2021\/may\/07\/chip-off-the-old-blocks-would-australias-empty-office-towers-be-better-off-as-housing","DATE":"2021-05-06 17:30:14","PLAIN_TEXT":"Its crazy to leave existing infrastructure empty when we have people sleeping in the streets, says Robert Pradolin, founder and executive director of Housing All Australians. As office blocks stand half empty in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, at the same time as a severe shortage in affordable housing makes headlines, it is tempting to think the former issue might be a solution to the latter. Related: Only three rental properties in Australia are affordable for singles on jobseeker - study Converting empty offices into apartments is back on the agenda, with New South Wales chief economist Stephen Walters suggesting it could be a solution to revitalising a floundering city centre. There are murmurs from developers in other cities too. However, leading design industry practitioners say the only Australian office buildings viable for conversion to residential flats were built before the 1980s. Pradolins organisation has been using vacant buildings awaiting development approval as pop up housing shelters, but he concedes that if its an existing office building thats B- or C-grade, the highest and best use is still probably [an] office building. Its really only prestige apartments doing well Several office block conversions took place in the CBDs of Melbourne and Sydney following the recessions in the early 1980s and 90s. This style of redevelopment is again being considered, but buildings deemed most suitable are generally in premium locations and priced accordingly. Tim Cassidy, a director at the real estate firm Cushman Wakefield in Sydney, believes low-occupancy commercial buildings in need of substantial refurbishments may well be targeted by developers eyeing the prestige market. But he says: Its really only prestige apartments doing well. Studios in the TNT Towers began at $695,000. Photograph: Brett Boardman Candalepas Associates, with Wendy Lewin, recently repurposed the 1970s-built TNT Towers at Redfern in Sydney into 181 apartments for the developer Deicorp. Apartment prices started at $695,000 for a studio, and stage one has sold out. BVNs reimagining of the heritage-listed 1960s former Water Board building - on Bathurst Street in central Sydney - is another recent example. As Pradolin explains, to convert an office block into affordable housing, the land owner will suffer a loss. Because these developments are not profitable, they are unlikely to take place without government intervention. Bedrooms need windows, as do living rooms Architect Angelo Candalepas says most commercial buildings constructed in the past 50 years do not work for long-term repurposing, with ceiling height, available light and natural ventilation the main impediments. Meanwhile, the Property Council estimates it could cost 20-30% more to retrofit office buildings than it would to demolish and purpose-build apartments. We in the world of architecture - or really development - produce a lot of buildings that are shrink-wrapped into their use in such a tight manner that none of them can be converted later, Candalepas says. Older buildings, even from as recently as the 1960s and 70s, were created with a sense of a broader future. The best of these face north, receiving good sun, with columns spaced conveniently for apartment layouts. Related: The latest data reveals just how insane the Australian housing market has become | Greg Jericho Creating a liveable apartment out of an office block hinges on the depth of the building floor plate - the distance between lifts and windows. In most modern office towers the floor plates are typically too large. You cant have it too deep and rooms too far in, because bedrooms need windows, as do living rooms, says architect David Stevenson of Lacoste + Stevenson, pointing to the way apartment layouts often address the space between facade and entry point. Weve all seen the livingdiningkitchen progression, to get from the facade back to the entry and lift. You were part of the fabric of the city The Property Council of Australia classifies office buildings according to grade and location - in line with perceptions of quality held by occupants and investors. A-premium or A-grade building may be brand new or newly refurbished, with solid green credentials and a prime location; B-grade buildings are well-maintained with adequate facilities and accessibility; and C-Grade buildings are generally older and less accessible. Stephen Turner, managing partner at Gray Puksand, whose firm converted Canberras Department of Social Services Buildings at Greenway to a senior living development pre-Covid, says that C-grade assets are a good starting point if they can be transformed to genuinely meet market demand and the needs of society. The senior living facility converted from a former government building in Greenway, Canberra. Photograph: Greenscenes Office block conversions are unlikely to be cheaper than new developments, but Turner says there can be other advantages. Adaptive reuse can retain the embodied energy of existing assets - and remove the assumption that new builds are the only option. When an office block is converted with sensitivity, it can also be a pleasure to live in. When Jayne and Mark Ferguson and their three teenage sons moved into the Residence - a residential apartment tower on the eastern side of Sydneys Hyde Park - keen for a city living experience between family homes, they found it soundproof and very private thanks to the towers solid construction. Related: Perths homelessness crisis: the WA election issue Mark McGowan cant shake off The building was constructed in 2008, transforming a 1970s concrete office block that once housed the NSW police headquarters into a prestige address. The design, by Scott Carver Architects, reimagined the tower as two slender wings to access light and views, taking in St Marys Cathedral, the Opera House and the Heads. It was like living in a hotel, Jayne says. The boys would have their friends around to use the pool and I would jog and walk the dog to Mrs Macquaries Chair. Mark and I both walked to work. Management consultant Eric Fleming intended to stay in Highgate, an office-turned-residential building overlooking the Sydney Harbour Bridge, for only a few months. His rental ended up stretching into an ownership, and he remained in the building for 15 years. The former Esso office tower conversion in 1996 was a great success, sweetened by amenities including a swimming pool and gym. The Residence apartment tower in Sydney was once NSW police headquarters. It was like living in a hotel, a former resident says. Photograph: Geoff Ambler Fleming recalls a few structural columns within the lower (former office) floor layouts, but he ended up purchasing an apartment on a newly added floor that was column-free. He and his wife moved out only four years ago when their second daughter arrived. We loved it and we really missed it when we left, Fleming says. I loved just sitting and looking at the view. And walking into the city for dinner ... you were part of the fabric of the city and that was really nice. Cities always go through cycles Property council data suggests CBD office occupancy rates around Australia are between 35% (Melbourne) and 84% (Darwin), with Sydney at 50%. Higher numbers of residents make for more vibrant city centres, but whether that means theres a market for another round of building conversions is debatable. For starters, Australians are steadily returning to the office, with Melbourne recording an 11% increase in office occupancy between the end of February and the end of March. Rob Backhouse, principal at global architecture and workplace specialist Hassell, suspects talking up office conversions - where larger building cores and structural columns can mean compromised living spaces - is hasty. Perhaps Im being optimistic but I think the office and our cities are underpinned by humans being social animals and wanting to be together when we work and play, he says. However, I do think the post-pandemic world will see a reduction in the office footprint of organisations. Related: You can smell if somethings going wrong: life in an eco-friendly goldfish bowl Backhouse says workplace design and amenity will adapt to become more diverse and magnetic. He points to the success of Melbournes postcode 3000 initiative in the early 90s, when a previously dead CBD was revived by new residential opportunities combined with a liquor licensing review that brought the streets and laneways to life. Cities always go through cycles but I think our cities will get better and more diverse as we move through this, Backhouse says. More experimental smaller entities will be able to afford to come back in and fill the C- and D-grade space that isnt justified for demolition. In the meantime, Pradolin will continue to make use of available space.

But despite the considerable perks, New Zealands Department of Conservation has been struggling to attract candidates to be their new biodiversity supervisor in Haast on the wild, remote coast of the South Island. Now, the regions search is going global. The job is based in Te Wahipounamu - an area encompassing 26,000 square kilometres of mountain ranges, isolated beaches and native forests, classed as a Unesco World Heritage Area in 1990. Its mountain ranges formed the backdrop for the White MountainsEred Nimrais in Peter Jacksons adaption of the Lord of the Rings. The successful applicant will be put to work protecting newly discovered populations of the Haast tokoeka kiwi - as well as keeping tabs on local fur seal and lizard populations, predator control and monitoring the local songbirds. They will work across remote, rugged areas, many of which are accessible only by helicopter or jetboat. The job advert calls the region an extremely special place to live, surrounded by mountains and ocean, with endless activities for an outdoor enthusiast, and a salary range of NZ$72,610 - $92,780. On Monday, however, the New Zealand Herald reported that the departments call for applicants had failed to attract significant interest, with just three people inquiring so far. Mount Aspiring national park, Part of Te Wahipounamu Photograph: Murdo MacLeodThe Guardian Wayne Costello, operations manager for DOC in South Westland, said the job was right for people who love spending time in nature, and are comfortable with a degree of isolation. It is working in one of the most amazing natural environments that the country has got to offer, he told Stuff. Its just spectacular. But it is not for everyone. Youd have to be self-reliant and be able to work in the outdoors. If youre interested in opera and theatre, its probably not for you. The Department of Conservation is not alone in struggling to attract workers to the areas wild beauty. This month, the west coasts regional development agency released a new campaign announcing it was on a global hunt for new coasters. Were looking for people who are sick of the crowds, cars and commercialism of the city, and would prefer a bit more space, Development West Coast chief executive Heath Milne said in a release. Many west coast businesses and organisations were crying out for staff, Milne said - and the region was particularly hoping to attract healthcare workers, with 50 vacancies in aged care, primary care, ED, mental health and inpatient services. Across New Zealand, many sectors have reported chronic labour and skills shortages, as more New Zealanders head overseas after the pandemic, and immigration gradually recovers. Job ad site SEEK reported a 27% increase in job listings on the west coast over the past year. The Coast is a special place that attracts a special kind of person, Milne said.

The film was supposed to feature a hunt for scientific equipment believed to have been left in the area by the Baudin expedition of 1800-1803. There was no trace of Napoleonic-era exploration, but what they did find was something perhaps even more unusual. It was 15cm-tall bronze Buddha figure, weighing just over 1kg and - according to experts - likely made in China hundreds of years ago. In the years since their 2018 find, the film-makers, Leon Deschamps and Shayne Thomson, have been working to uncover the mystery of how the figurine ended up on a roadside in Shark Bay. They believe the Buddha might be a clue that could rewrite history, potentially suggesting that Ming dynasty explorers visited Australia hundreds of years ago. Shayne Thomson and Leon Deschamps say they have spent $50,000 trying to work out the statues origins since finding it in 2018. Photograph: FINN films World treasure Hoping to find out more about the object, the pair sought out expert advice on the British TV show, Antiques Roadshow. In an episode that screened in the UK on Sunday, the shows Asian art expert, Lee Young, the managing director of Dore and Rees auctioneers in Somerset, confirmed the figurine was made during Chinas Ming dynasty and declared it a world treasure. Lets clear it up straight away. Yes, it is Ming, Young said. And yes it is the infant Buddha. He was brought out in ceremonies to celebrate Buddhas birthday, which is why its portrayed as the infant Buddha. According to Young, the figurine would have belonged to someone of some standing. The Infant Buddha must be the oldest [Chinese] object that has been discovered in Australia, Prof Jocelyn Chey said. Photograph: FINN films via Facebook Young said the Ming dynasty piece would carry a presale estimate of PS3,000 to PS5,000 (A$5,000 to A$9,000). But the location it was found made it historically incredibly important and he would not be surprised if the hammer fell at PS100,000 at an open market auction because there is only one of these with that story. Ian MacLeod, a fellow of the WA Museum who has examined over 35,000 bronze objects for museums, confirmed through microscopic analysis the Buddha was unequivocally not a forgery. MacLeod found that the Buddha had been buried at the spot where it was discovered between 100 and 150 years prior, and that it had been used for a considerable period of time before the burial - consistent with it dating back to the Ming period. Deschamps said the Buddha could have been left behind by the Ming dynasty treasure fleet of 1421, which was sent out by the third Ming emperor in a display of Chinese might. Seven expeditions made up of hundreds of ships travelled through south-east Asia - even reaching the coast of Africa - but there is no documented evidence of them reaching Australia. Most historians say it is unlikely that Chinese ships visited Australia during the Ming dynasty - which would be hundreds of years before the first European explorers in the 1600s - but the prospect has nevertheless been a source of enduring fascination. Oldest Chinese object in Australia? Jocelyn Chey, a visiting professor in the department of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney, said it was unlikely that the Chinese treasure fleet visited the Gascoyne area of Western Australia, if it visited Australia at all. It doesnt mean because its 500 years old, that it came here 500 years ago, Chey said. Regardless of when it came here, it must be the oldest [Chinese] object that has been discovered in Australia. That is assuming that its authenticity is confirmed. Related: French coast: the early explorers who sparked British fears of a Francophone Australia Paul Macgregor, a historian and curator with Our Chinese Past Inc, said he believed the two most likely scenarios were that the object arrived with the Chinese pearlers or fishermen in the 1870s or that it was deposited by someone as a hoax. Macgregor said there was no firm evidence of any Ming dynasty treasure fleet arriving in Australia. He said that any evidence of the Buddhas origins needs to be published so that it can be tested by other experts. Deschamps still hasnt found a home for the Buddha. The WA Maritime Museum didnt want to display it when the film-makers offered it to them and their local Shark Bay Discovery Centre museum was not a suitable location due to the lack of funds to properly insure and protect the Buddha. Sacred objects belong with the communities they are sacred to, Deschamps wrote in a statement on behalf of him and Thomson. We do not consider ourselves owners of the Infant Buddha but rather custodians and we have done our utmost to show this sacred object the respect it deserves. Deschamps said that the pairs film company has spent at least $50,000 on travel, laboratory research and interviews with scientists and academics trying to get to the bottom of the objects origin. It is our hope the Australian government will work with the Chinese community and local Indigenous custodians to co-fund an archaeological dig at the site to help further investigate the origins of the Buddha, Deschamps wrote. He said they have made ongoing efforts to consult with police, local and state government, the WA Maritime Museum, various Chinese organisations, Australian archaeologists and local Indigenous elders.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/aug\/17\/hard-working-civil-servants-deserve-respect-wherever-they-are-working","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/aug\/17\/hard-working-civil-servants-deserve-respect-wherever-they-are-working","DATE":"2021-08-17 17:24:43","PLAIN_TEXT":"I was really disheartened to read recent attacks on civil servants by an unnamed cabinet minister (Civil servants working from home not at risk of pay cut, says Kwarteng, theguardian.com, 9 August). These constant verbal assaults and the implication that civil servants dont work hard enough - that if were not in the office we must be watching television - are not only unequivocally false, but theyre damaging what morale is left in the civil service. Im a mid-ranking civil servant in the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. Like the majority of my colleagues, Ive spent the past 18 months trying to juggle the needs of my day job with working on Covid management. Its not my purpose to moan about this - Im well aware that compared to the horrific experiences of medical staff and the pressures theyve been under, weve had it easier than many. Still, Ive seen colleagues regularly working 15- or 16-hour days or even longer, particularly at the peak of the pandemic. My colleagues set up the shielding scheme from scratch and at breakneck speed to make sure the most vulnerable in society were protected. Mortgage holidays, the ban on tenant evictions, facilitating the Everyone In campaign for homeless people - weve done all this and so much more while carrying on with the bulk of business as usual, establishing new schemes including First Homes and progressing building safety policy to try to address the horror revealed by the Grenfell tragedy. Yet were continually attacked with implications that were idle, overpaid and unnecessary. Ministers habitually use us as a target to deflect criticism from themselves. Rightwing newspapers, desperate to shift copies of their free commuter papers, demand we go back to offices. All this when many of us are absolutely burnt out and exhausted with keeping government running during a pandemic. And all with no one advocating on our behalf. We dont want special treatment, just a little respect. Please.Name and address supplied * Anybody reading the papers in recent days would have a pretty clear sense that government ministers are fed up with people, in particular civil servants, working from home. From warnings of pay cuts to talk about the impact on promotion, the message appears to be simple: get back to your desks. The benefits of office life and face-to-face working are clear, and following the phenomenal success of our vaccination programme theres an understandable eagerness in some quarters for a return to life as we knew it. But the changes in working habits over the last 18 months are about much more than not wanting to pay to sit on an overcrowded train, or trying to avoid scrutiny, as appears to be the implication from some. Simply returning to how things were before would be to overlook that digital adoption and working practices in the UK have advanced by a decade in the past two years. The government needs to be bold. Hybrid working benefits civil servants and helps the government deliver its wider objectives: from shaping the future of cities and towns to avoiding brain drain and dormant commuter towns to stimulating regional growth and creating equal opportunity. And as the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, recently highlighted, the benefits of flexible work can empower those with caring responsibilities, and have a wider positive impact on equality. People will continue to work together to overcome any obstacles that lie ahead, and technology will continue to play a pivotal role in defining whats next. As we look to the economic recovery, the government has the opportunity to work with employees, businesses, and city leaders to engage in a conversation that has the potential to define what our world of work looks like in 10 or 20 years time.

So, if your personal circumstances allow it, what about escaping abroad for the coldest months of the year? Tom Church, the co-founder of the money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk, is one of them. He says he is considering packing his bags after concluding his rising gas and electricity bills will cost him more than renting somewhere in Europe this winter. I wondered: What if I close up the house, turn everything off, and head off for the most expensive months?, Church said. If youre a renter and can cancel your contract to move abroad for a few months, you can save hundreds. You also need to be able to afford the upfront costs of accommodation and flights The apartments are cheaper to rent and the energy costs are often a lot less, he adds. The shift to flexible working ushered in by the coronavirus pandemic means the idea is not as radical as it would have seemed a few years ago. The ability to do this of course requires a lot of flexibility and is more likely to appeal to remote-working singles, couples and young families and retirees than say those with school-age children. You also need to be able to afford the upfront costs of accommodation and flights. However, Church is not the only one considering his options, with online searches for move abroad up sharply in recent months amid a worsening cost of living squeeze. Last month the energy industry regulator for Great Britain confirmed an 80% rise in the consumer price cap from October that will take a typical households gas and electricity bill to PS3,549 a year. The next cap, for the period January to March 2023, could be higher still at more than PS5,000. A typical energy bill will go up by 80% in October. Photograph: Paul MarriottRexShutterstock The new cap, which kicks in on 1 October, equates to a direct debit of almost PS300 a month, although some will pay a lot more. Church says his predicted bill for December alone is more than PS500. A lot will also depend on your housing setup. You will still have to pay rent or mortgage costs while you are away, unless, for example, you are prepared to give up your tenancy and find somewhere new to live when you return. That said, some people are fortunate enough to currently have very low mortgage costs. The latest research by the estate agent chain Hamptons International shows the average rent for a one-bed flat in the UK is PS929 a month - and is considerably more than that in London. Number-crunching suggests some people could spend three months in Europe for less than PS2,000, including flights, accommodation, wifi and energy costs, and enjoy a cheaper cost of living in general. However, Church adds: I want to clarify something. I dont think this is a good option for anyone. Its absurd! We are in a dire situation - I see in my money-saving community that people are struggling. To save on your energy bills by leaving for a few months should not have to be an option at all. Before you leave If you do decide to follow Churchs lead, there are several things you need to consider when shutting up your home for the winter. Let your supplier know you are going away and will not be using gas or electricity for several months. Suppliers including British Gas and Octopus confirmed that direct debit bills will be reduced if you tell them you are going away. You will still have to pay the standing charge if there is a meter at your property, so your bills will not reduce to zero. If you do shut up your home and move away for the winter, empty your fridge and freezer - and defrost the latter - before switching off the appliances at the mains. Photograph: incamerastockAlamy The daily standing charges for electricity and gas will be capped at 46p and 28p from October. However, those rates are averages and will vary by region, payment method and meter type. Empty your fridge and freezer - and defrost the freezer - before switching off the appliances at the mains. However, while turning your boiler off while you are away would clearly save you money, it is a risky move during the winter that could cause problems - for example, if your pipes freeze. Most boilers can be timed to switch on for an hour a day. E.ON recommends timing it for between 3am and 4am, which is usually the coldest time of the day. Alternatively, you could drain the heating system and shut off the water supply. Renting out your home while you are away is one way to recoup costs but make sure to double-check the terms of your contract if you are a tenant, as many landlords will not allow you to sublet. If you are a homeowner, you will have to consider the extra costs you might incur by becoming a temporary landlord, and enlist someone in the local area as a point of contact for your tenants while you are out of the country. It would also be worth getting a friend or neighbour to check in at your home while you are away, whether that is to water the plants or for extra security. Double-check your insurance policy, too, to see if it becomes void if your home is left unoccupied for a certain number of days. You might have to buy a top-up policy. Accommodation Airbnb allows guests to book stays longer than 28 days, and energy bills are typically included in the total price. But check the house rules carefully before booking as they could include extra information about bills - for example, whether you will have to pay more in certain circumstances. Contact the host to come to an agreement about bills, and make sure you get it in writing to avoid conflict later on. Airbnb property in Spain. Photograph: Perla RequejoReuters If a host tries to charge for something that was not included in the listing description or house rules, guests can open a dispute with Airbnb. When booking through other platforms such as Booking.com or directly with the property owner, make sure you get clarity on how you will be charged for gas and electricity. We checked out how much a three-month stay in or around Malaga in southern Spain would cost on Airbnb. The amount you pay will depend on your requirements - for example, whether you are happy staying in your hosts spare room or would prefer the whole place to yourself. When we looked, a small flat with a terrace and a sea view in Torremolinos, west of Malaga, would cost PS2,701 for the entire trip. Meanwhile, a room in a flat 15 minutes from the beach in Malaga would cost PS1,476 for the full three-month period, although you would have to share the bathroom and kitchen with other guests. Church found that some of the cheapest rentals were in France but there were also interesting options a little further afield in places such as Montenegro and Romania. Many apartments abroad offer free cancellation, so you can book now and cancel later if you change your mind. Flights When we checked on the flight comparison website Skyscanner, you could get direct return flights between London and Malaga for PS58 with Wizz Air and Vueling, leaving on 1 October and returning on 31 December. Those figures do not include the cost of hold luggage, which you would presumably need for a three-month stay and would have to pay extra for. Double-check the Covid rules in your destination before you book. Working abroad After Brexit, UK citizens can only stay in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein for 90 days or less within a 180-day period without a visa. This is mainly aimed at tourists but there are some work-related allowances such as attending a business meeting or conference. Spain is planning to introduce a visa for people working remotely for foreign companies Double-check the visa requirements in the country you are planning to visit to avoid breaking the rules. Spain is planning to introduce a visa for people working remotely for foreign companies - sometimes known as digital nomads - but it has not yet been introduced. That means UK passport holders may need to apply to the Spanish consulate for a visa if they are planning to work remotely for a UK company while in the country. Sybille Steiner, an employment law partner at the solicitors Irwin Mitchell, says: Individuals should not enter a EU country as a tourist and then start working there, as that is likely to violate immigration rules. The rules here will differ according to the country, and I recommend that local advice is taken. There could also be tax implications for your employer, Steiner says.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"unicef-world-immunisation-week-2021\/2021\/apr\/24\/what-it-takes-to-deliver-vaccines-to-remote-communities","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/unicef-world-immunisation-week-2021\/2021\/apr\/24\/what-it-takes-to-deliver-vaccines-to-remote-communities","DATE":"2021-04-23 14:01:10","PLAIN_TEXT":"Baby Kholud is one of the lucky ones. Her mother, Suad, knows how important it is that she receives vaccinations against life-threatening diseases. The vaccines protect her from sickness and disease, Suad says. I hope for her to have all the good things in life and an education. Twenty-two thousand children live in the Azraq Refugee Camp in Jordan. Its the only home Kholud has ever known - she was born here. The risk of contagious diseases spreading around camps like Azraq is high, and can have devastating consequences for families living in close proximity to one other. Through UNICEFs long-running vaccine campaign, at three months of age, Kholud received vaccines that protected her against diseases including rotavirus, polio, diphtheria and hepatitis B. Her vaccinations help limit her own risk of disease, but also slows the spread to others. As one of the millions of children vaccinated by UNICEF, Kholud has been given a chance to grow up healthy and reach her full potential. Almost 20 million children below the age of one do not receive their recommended vaccines against measles, polio and other preventable diseases, says Felicity Butler-Wever, director of international programs, UNICEF Australia. For children living in remote or war-torn areas, accessing vaccinations and healthcare is even more challenging. Where a countrys health system needs support, UNICEF and its partners are there to help out. Each year, UNICEF teams vaccinate nearly half the worlds children against preventable diseases. This life-changing work is carried out in some of Earths most remote and vulnerable areas, even involving the deployment of light planes, boats, drones and donkeys to deliver vaccines through difficult terrain and to deeply isolated communities. Immunisation is the key to ending vaccine-preventable child deaths and giving children a chance to grow up healthy and reach their full potential. However, around the world, many children live in geographically remote areas, where getting access to vaccination programs becomes a challenge.

In 2021, the organisation is building on its experience and expertise to protect the worlds most vulnerable from Covid-19. UNICEF is leading the delivery and supply of Covid-19 vaccines to 92 low and low-mid-income countries, working as a key member of COVAX, the global initiative to ensure the vaccine is equally distributed to all. This year UNICEF will help deliver 2 billion Covid-19 vaccines for health workers and the most vulnerable, calling on all our expertise in vaccination to get the Covid-19 vaccine to the most high-risk people across the globe, Butler-Wever says. This is not without its challenges, especially as the Covid-19 vaccine must be kept at specific temperatures, meaning UNICEF must prepare a network of fridges and cold storage systems to keep the vaccines safe. Last month, UNICEF helped to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to an area in Nepals remote far-west, nestled in the rugged Himalayas. The vaccine and other critical equipment - syringes and medical tools - were transported first by air, then vehicle and finally by foot through mountainous terrain.

UNICEF vaccine teams and local community organisers are already traversing mountains and rivers, entering urban slums and rural villages to deliver vaccines against measles, polio and other maternal and childhood illnesses. With the Covid-19 vaccine now ready for distribution, together with partners, UNICEF will harness solar power, mobile technology and telemetrics to deliver the vaccine at the right temperature, protecting it from exposure in even the most extreme weather conditions. As well as ensuring the vaccines themselves arrive safely, UNICEF is helping countries counter misinformation and build trust in immunisation, training health workers and engaging communities to have confidence in this life-saving project. However, as Covid-19 vaccinations continue, UNICEF says we must not allow our fight against one deadly disease to allow the return of another. Its reporting shows that in November 2020, with measles campaigns paused in many countries, more than 94 million children were at risk of missing measles vaccines. Alongside our mission to help deliver the Covid-19 vaccine, its critical we continue all our lifesaving work vaccinating the worlds children to ensure that diseases like polio and measles that were widespread in the past, stay in the past, Butler-Wever says.

The phone service comes after the killings of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. How will it work?

Before setting off on their journey, they would start the app, which would give the expected journey time and track them via the phones GPS system. Alternatively, they can also call or text 888. A message would be sent to them at the time they were predicted to arrive home. If they failed to respond, emergency contacts would then be called and then the police would be notified.

He told the Daily Mail: The simple act of walking home is making people feel anxious and at risk. BT is responsible for running the 999 emergency phone number. What has the reaction been to it? The system has been backed by Patel after being contacted by Jansen. She told the Daily Mail: This new phone line is exactly the kind of innovative scheme which would be good to get going as soon as we can. Im now looking at it with my team and liaising with BT. Some campaigners have spoken about it deferring the problem on to women rather than tackling the problem of violence against women and girls and a low rate of criminal convictions. Womans Trust, a charity that provides mental health support to women who are victims of domestic violence, said: Womens freedoms and rights shouldnt be quashed to make more room and excuses for male violence. Funding an app while survivors continue to be let down by the health and criminal justice systems is not the answer. Police Federation spokesperson Phill Matthews said it could create problems if it created more work for police, but said the body would not be opposed to anything that increased public safety. How much will the service cost and when could it begin? The project could cost about PS50m, according to PA Media. It could be up and running by Christmas.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/aug\/15\/att-workers-fight-company-return-to-office-push","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/aug\/15\/att-workers-fight-company-return-to-office-push","DATE":"2022-08-15 09:00:34","PLAIN_TEXT":"The Covid-19 pandemic sent millions of workers in the US from working in offices to working remotely. As unemployment benefits ended, vaccines rolled out, and reopenings expanded, employers and commercial real estate groups have been pushing to try to get workers back into offices. But the pandemic further exposed the issues in returning to office, from long commutes to and from work, exorbitant childcare costs, ongoing concerns over exposure to Covid-19 variants and now monkeypox, workers are pushing to keep working from home as an option as employers force a return to the office. At AT&amp;T, the worlds largest telecommunication company, workers represented by the Communications Workers of America agreed to a work from home extension until the end of March 2023, but workers say the company is forcing many workers to return to the office much sooner than that, while other departments had already been forced back to the office by their managers. James Bloch, an AT&amp;T employee in Cleveland, Ohio, for 21 years, said the work from home option has been beneficial for workers mental health, protection from Covid-19, productivity, attendance and carbon footprint. These are extremely stressful times over the last few years and being at home has allowed us to have less distractions, giving us better one-on-one time with our customers and our clients, said Bloch. With AT&amp;T technology, theyre a communication company. We have some of the best stuff out there. Lets use it. We can do the same job from home anywhere that we could do if we were all sitting there together. Other workers agree. Sara Fry, an AT&amp;T service representative in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said her department was told they were being brought back to the office as early as 21 September 2022. Fry argued AT&amp;T has not provided workers with adequate explanations and details as to why they are forcing workers to return to the office. She speculated the decision stemmed from exerting control over workers and undermining the union. All of our production is great. Our attendance numbers have improved since folks have been working from home and this news is just crushing. Its heartbreaking, she said. I dont think management realizes how deeply hurt and how deeply angry some employees will be about this AT&amp;T workers have started a petition demanding the company makes working from home a permanent option for workers. We dont understand if were still in a pandemic, were still considered essential workers and were still doing the appropriate job, then why are we coming back to the office? said Chuck Elgert, communication technician at AT&amp;T and executive vice-president of CWA Local 6350 in St Louis, Missouri. Theres no reason to risk anybodys health and safety thats not 100% necessary to run the operations of the business. He emphasized workers were also concerned because AT&amp;T has an ageing workforce, particularly in departments where many workers are over the age of 55, and that AT&amp;T has workplace surveillance tools in place so that managers can constantly monitor the work that workers are doing from home and make changes if necessary. Val Williams, an AT&amp;T worker and union steward for the Communications Workers of America in Houston, Texas, was forced to return to work in the office in April 2022. She criticized the push to bring workers back into the office after she said workers had been praised for productivity while working from home. When she returned to work, it was to a new building where not all departments had been brought back, and Williams argued Covid-19 infections have continued to be an issue in the workplace and Covid-19 sick leave is currently inadequate, with five days off. Williams criticized the pushback to return to the office given AT&amp;T is a communications company with the technology and resources to make working from home a seamless option. Our revenue has increased over the last two years while we were working from home. Our job descriptions state we are capable of working with little to minimum management and thats what weve been doing, she said. She also argued it was unfair how the push to return workers to the office has been enforced, with some departments being brought back while others are still working from home. We dont feel like anybodys health is greater than any others. Because everybody has their own health issues, or they may have family members that have health issues that they have to return home to, she added. Charli Haataja, another AT&amp;T worker in Minneapolis, Minnesota, compared returning to the office as enacting a pay cut given the amount of money workers would need to spend on gas, on monthly parking fees, childcare and the extra time it takes to commute. Working from home has been a gamechanger for employees that most of us have not seen in our lifetimes working in our work careers, to have gained back any kind of work-life balance, or peace of mind in the workplace, to have your circumstances improve, rather than get worse, Haataja said. A spokesperson for AT&amp;T did not provide data on how many workers at the company are still working from home, but claimed it was never the companys intention to make working from home indefinite. The health and safety of our employees continues to be our priority, said the spokesperson in an email. As we have throughout the pandemic, we adhere to guidance from the medical community, including implementing safety protocols to help protect our employees wellbeing. And now that we are a largely vaccinated workforce, we believe its safe for employees to return to the workplace. We do our best work when were together.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2023\/mar\/07\/schools-in-england-seeing-more-pupil-absences-on-fridays","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/mar\/07\/schools-in-england-seeing-more-pupil-absences-on-fridays","DATE":"2023-03-08 00:00:41","PLAIN_TEXT":"Schools in England are experiencing a huge amount of pupil absence on Fridays, with many children staying at home with their parents and caregivers after a shift in attitudes since Covid, MPs have been told. Dame Rachel de Souza, the childrens commissioner for England, told the education committee that persistent absence from schools was one of the issues of our age and called for a razor sharp focus on the problem. The committee heard that mental health issues, disadvantage and unmet special educational needs and disabilities were significant factors behind increased persistent absence in schools since the Covid crisis. De Souza said she had data analysis that showed 818,000 of the 1.6 million children who were persistently absent across the autumn and spring terms in 2021-22 were off school for reasons other than illness. I think thats very serious, she said. She also told MPs that discussions with families had revealed a number of additional reasons why children were missing school. One is because of online learning in Covid, theres a little bit of, Well, why cant we just have online learning. So that attitude has come through a bit. She also pointed to analysis of attendance data - before and after Covid - provided by a number of large multi-academy trusts, which showed a jump in the number of pupils not attending school on Fridays, a trend that did not exist before the pandemic. Were seeing a huge amount of Friday absence that wasnt there before, she told the committee. Parents are at home on Fridays. Weve had evidence from kids: Well, you know, mum and dad are at home, stay at home. More parents are working from home as patterns changed as a result of the Covid crisis. MPs also heard that a cultural shift away from schools as purely places of academic learning with a new emphasis on enrichment activities and pastoral care could help improve attendance. Alice Wilcock, the head of education at the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) thinktank, said increased academic pressure to catch up, plus the feeling that activities pupils enjoyed such as sport or music were being squeezed out of the curriculum, were fostering a disengagement from education. She called for a particular focus on severe absence, where pupils miss more than 50% of school sessions, and said the CSJ had pointed out that numbers multiplied over the past 10 years to 118,000 children. As of autumn 2020, more than 1,000 schools had an entire class-worth of children who were severely absent. Meanwhile, long waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services meant pupils with anxiety and other mental health disorders that make attendance difficult were in effect being pushed out of school, MPs were told. A separate report, published by the childrens commissioners office on Wednesday, found that average waiting times between children being referred to mental health services and starting treatment had increased for the first time since 2017. According to the commissioners analysis, they have risen from 32 days in 2020-21 to 40 days in 2021-22. It highlighted the so-called postcode lottery parents still face, with stark differences in waiting times depending on where you live, from 13 days in Leicester to 80 in Sunderland. De Souza noted the high proportion of girls detained under the Mental Health Act. Of the 869 children detained in 2021-2, 71% were female, the commissioners analysis showed. Overall, however, there had been a fall in the number of children detained, sectioned, or admitted to inpatient mental health wards. The commissioner said: Its clear that mental health support for children across the country is patchy, despite some good progress made by the NHS in the years leading up to the pandemic. A government spokesperson said: We are already investing PS2.3bn a year into mental health services, meaning an additional 345,000 children and young people will be able to access NHS-funded mental health support they need by 2024. Support in school is vital, and we are committed to increasing the number of mental health teams to almost 400 by April 2023, providing support to 3 million children and young people.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/jul\/29\/let-there-be-light-a-radically-revamped-1980s-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/jul\/29\/let-there-be-light-a-radically-revamped-1980s-home","DATE":"2022-07-29 05:00:47","PLAIN_TEXT":"When John and Kate Cameron were looking to downsize from their Victorian family home in a suburb of Edinburgh after their children left home, they decided to go for a real change: a 1980s brutalist-style brick house in a suburb close to the city centre. The couple knew and loved the house - built in 1982 by Scottish architect Douglas Abrahams for his own family, and set within a walled garden in one of the citys most picturesque suburbs - as the previous owners were family members who had lived in it since the mid-80s. But for all its character and charm, it didnt suit the way they lived. The layout, particularly ground-floor living areas, was warren-like, with compartmentalised rooms (such as the dining room and kitchen, which were separated by a serving hatch), convoluted corridors and unusual level changes. And with few windows to the south the house felt dark and smaller than it was. The bathrooms were also dated and there was a long, narrow sunroom on the first floor that wasnt really used. Vintage furniture in the living area sits happily with designer pieces, such as a sofa from Heals. Photograph: Martin Safro So they decided to radically transform it. The main idea was to modernise and adapt it without losing the feel of the original house, says Kate. The proportions were designed around a smaller person than John, so we removed some of the unusual level changes and stair heights. And we wanted to maximise light and views to the garden. They enlisted Edinburgh-based architect Jens Bergmark, with whom they had worked on their previous house. The challenge was to take care to preserve and refine the character of the house while transforming it in quite a radical way, says Bergmark. So, rationalising the spaces, getting rid of all the passages, corridors and cupboards, and improving the layout. The living area of the repurposed granny flat. Photograph: Martin Safro Bergmarks solution was principally to make the house more open plan, to create a smoother flow. He lifted or lowered the floors in certain areas so that the level changes disappeared, and added an extension with an open-plan diningkitchen area: this overlooks and encloses part of the south-facing garden, forming a sheltered L-shaped courtyard with a slabbed patio area, edge planting and a much-used pizza oven. On the first floor, the former sunroom was converted into an en suite bathroom and dressing area for the master bedroom. Its about modifying what youve got and not making a big statement to prove your worth Jens Bergmark Inspiration for the interiors came from the original house, with an emphasis on exposed brick. The brick that came down in the demolition was reused to clad the new timber-frame garden extension. Bergmark added light oak floors, replacing the former brick floor of the lounge to soften the space, and moved original bespoke cabinets and shelving to new areas of the house, mainly the dining room, to suit the new layout. Inherited furniture, such as a set of Georgian dining chairs, combine happily with modern designer pieces including a vintage Ikea table and light fittings from Catalog Interiors. They also found room for upcycled armchairs and dining chairs reupholstered by Kate. One of the key features of the original house was a two-storey self-contained flat to the left of the main entrance. Although connected to the main house, the small, one-bedroom pad could function as separate living quarters, with its own kitchen, living area and bathroom. Related: Outside space? Thats the beach: restoring a 300-year-old fishing cottage Its living room overlooked the main entrance to the house, says Kate. This created privacy issues, so Bergmark flipped the whole granny flat upside down, with the kitchen and living room upstairs and the bedrooms downstairs, looking out of the house in the other direction, away from the main entrance. There is a lot more privacy now, she says. The flat proved extremely useful during the pandemic, when it became Johns office. He can lock the door to it at the weekend and not go back in until Monday, says Kate. We also stayed in it while work was going on in the main house. The granny flat is now self-contained accommodation for visitors. The new open-plan kitchen and dining area. Photograph: Martin Safro As part of the renovation, the energy efficiency of the house has been vastly improved, with more insulation and triple-glazed windows. Opening the house up more to the south has also increased its solar gain, says Bergmark. The house is so warm and efficient, light and bright, adds Kate. We sit outside way more than we could have imagined. Not only is the house ideal for post-pandemic working, its also a canny example of updating and refurbishment, ultimately preserving a charming architectural curio. This project is about a gentle touch, says Bergmark. Its about modifying what youve got and not making a big statement. Its not grandiose. If it looks seamless, thats a compliment.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/oct\/13\/ann-king-video-abuse-reigate-grange-care-home-surrey","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/oct\/13\/ann-king-video-abuse-reigate-grange-care-home-surrey","DATE":"2022-10-13 16:00:24","PLAIN_TEXT":"An 88-year-old woman with dementia was physically and mentally abused at a luxury care home charging residents close to PS100,000 a year, the Guardian can reveal. Staff misconduct was exposed by secret filming inside the home run by Signature Senior Lifestyle, which operates 36 luxury facilities mostly in the south of England. It has admitted that Ann King was mistreated at Reigate Grange in Surrey earlier this year. Distressing footage from a covert camera inside her room shows: * Care staff handling King roughly, causing her to cry out in distress. On one occasion she was left on the floor for 50 minutes. * King being taunted, mocked and sworn at when she was confused and frightened. * The retired nurse being assaulted by a cleaner, who hits her with a rag used to clean a toilet while she is lying in bed. * The cleaner threatening to empty a bin on the pensioners head and making indecent sexual gestures in her face. Related: I will always hear her screams: family tell of heartbreak over care home abuse The abuse was exposed by Kings children, Richard Last and Clare Miller. They became so concerned about her wellbeing at the care home, where she lived from January 2021 to March 2022, that they installed a hidden camera on her bedside table. They have shared the footage because they fear what happened to their mother may not be an isolated incident, and because: She has always been horrified by this type of thing and we felt she would have wanted us to show this is going on. Signature is described as the most expensive care operator in the UK by LaingBuisson, a market research company, and looks after more than 2,000 residents. It is owned by Revera, a Canada-based care company with more than 550 facilities worldwide, which in turn is wholly owned by a PS150bn Canadian institutional pension fund investor. Reigate Grange is one of an expanding chain of luxury homes operated by Signature that promise luxury living, exceptional care. Jayne Easterbrook, a nurse for 42 years and an expert in training care workers, described what she saw in the footage as abuse and said the carers were aggressive, violent and in the wrong job. Interactive In one clip, when Ann was disoriented and asked Where am I?, a male care worker crouched down close to her face and said: Youre in a fucking home. Surrey police were called to investigate the footage. The cleaner, an agency worker, admitted common assault in early summer and has been blocked from working for the care company. One care worker has been fired, two resigned when confronted with the allegations, and one has been retrained. The manager of the care home at the time now runs another care home operated by Signature. It said it had full confidence in the manager as a committed and values-driven home leader, and that no investigations had identified concerns about their performance. Signature apologised to the family and insisted the reprehensible behaviour was committed by rogue individuals. But the family believe it was the result of wider cultural problems. The latest Care Quality Commission inspection report, published in April after King left the home, cut its rating from good to requires improvement. It found leadership was inconsistent and leaders and the culture they created did not always support the delivery of high-quality, person-centred care. Signature strongly denies the conduct was systemic or linked to the management of the home or organisation. Richard Last and Clare Miller with their mother Ann King. Photograph: Sean SmithThe Guardian King is now being cared for at home by her daughter, but appears to have been affected by the experiences, which included having her bed shaken, being yanked into a sitting position by her pyjama top and shoved backwards into a chair. She has asked me to hide in the wardrobe to stop the people coming in at night and hurting me, Miller said. The recordings showed how carers responsible for checking her incontinence pads in the middle of the night rolled her roughly and restrained her, causing her to cry out in distress, and laughed while doing so. As well as flicking King with the toilet rag, the cleaner aggressively fist-bumped her causing her to complain Youre hurting me, waggled his hips suggestively in her face and made a masturbating gesture at her. After the family showed Surrey police some of the footage he was interviewed under caution, admitted common assault and received a community resolution - an out-of-court arrangement. On a separate occasion, a female care worker ignored Kings repeated calls for attention and turned up the music in her room which drowned her out. The footage also showed kind behaviour from other staff, and Last was keen to stress that other workers in the home were caring. Related: Abuse, no other word for it: a nurse analyses Reigate care home footage When we saw this abuse it emotionally upset both of us and made us very, very angry, Last said of himself and his sister. There are around 900,000 people with dementia in the UK and demand is surging for specialist end of life care at a time when there are more than 160,000 social care staff vacancies. Kings fees were PS8,000 a month - more than three times higher than a typical local authority care home. Signature recently acquired two other chains, Sunrise Senior Living and Gracewell Healthcare. Reigate Grange has marketed itself as being akin to a luxury cruise ship and Signature has properties in affluent areas, such as Sonning, in Berkshire, and Virginia Water, in Surrey. It is building three new facilities a year, including on The Bishops Avenue, also known as billionaires row, in north London. Signature has since offered an apology to King and her family, waiving PS9,800 in outstanding fees and offering PS5,000 in compensation in full and final settlement of all and any claims they may make about her care. The family has rejected the compensation. Last, an electrician from Surrey, replied in writing: My mum did not pay to get abused at your care home and the ... poor care has made our mum suffer and us as a family. Signature pays care workers PS12 an hour, PS2.50 more than the average in England, and said it trains each worker in skills that include moving and handling residents, privacy and dignity, and dementia awareness. A spokesperson for Signature said: The behaviour of the individuals concerned was reprehensible, and fell far short of the standards of care we provide our residents every day. We would like to again apologise to Mrs King and her family, and reassure our community that these actions were committed by rogue individuals. Reigate Grange care home in Reigate, Surrey. Photograph: Martin GodwinThe Guardian When shown the footage by the family in May it said it alerted the relevant authorities and police, suspended the staff and removed the agency worker. It deployed an undercover supervisor and told other residents and families that significant concerns had been identified at the home and encouraged them to report any concerns they may have to the councils safeguarding team. Separate independent reviews were also undertaken by the council safeguarding team and Care Quality Commission (CQC). The individuals no longer work for us and they have been reported to the Disclosure and Barring Service to prevent them working in care again. We will fully support any legal action taken against them. We remain committed to doing everything we can to deliver the highest quality care, and to ensuring peace of mind for the residents who make their home with us, and their loved ones. A surprise night time inspection by the CQC in March prompted by information of concern from several families, including Kings, Surrey county council and the local clinical commissioning group exposed several risks to the residents, said Deanna Westwood, a director of operations at the regulator. The inspection report found risks to peoples safety and wellbeing were not always robustly monitored. Signature stressed the home was still ranked good in three out of five categories, and claimed the criticisms were minor and easily addressable. It said the CQC found staff were aware of their responsibilities to keep people safe from the risk of abuse and said the actions of a few rogue individuals should not be construed as being representative of the wider staff team, or Signature as a whole. Surrey county council said it was monitoring the provider and reviewing information recently provided by the family, which the Guardian understands includes all the undercover film footage and other documents covering Kings stay at Reigate Grange.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/sep\/28\/covid-might-have-changed-peoples-personalities-study-suggests","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/sep\/28\/covid-might-have-changed-peoples-personalities-study-suggests","DATE":"2022-09-28 18:00:13","PLAIN_TEXT":"The impact of the Covid pandemic may have been so deep that it altered peoples personalities, according to research. Previously psychologists have failed to find a link between collective stressful events, such as earthquakes or hurricanes, and personality change. However, something about the losses experienced or simply the long grind of social isolation appears to have made an impact. Younger adults became moodier and more prone to stress, less cooperative and trusting, and less restrained and responsible, according to the authors of the study, led by Prof Angelina Sutin of Florida State University College of Medicine. Sutin and colleagues used assessments of personality from 7,109 people enrolled in the online Understanding America Study that had been repeated at various times before and during the pandemic. Participants were given a widely used personality test that measures five traits - neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Participants, aged 18 to 109, took the tests pre-pandemic, early and later in the pandemic, with an average of three tests per participant. During the first phase of the pandemic (March to December 2020), personality was relatively stable, with only a small decline in neuroticism compared with pre-pandemic. This could be down to Covid providing a reason for feelings of anxiety and making it less likely for people to blame their own disposition, the authors suggested. The reduction in neuroticism had disappeared by the second half of the pandemic (2021-2022), the study suggested, and was replaced by declines in extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness compared to pre-pandemic personality. The changes were about one-tenth of a standard deviation, equivalent to the size of fluctuation typically seen over a decade of life. Younger adults showed the biggest changes and the oldest group of adults had no significant changes in traits. According to the authors, personality tends to be more malleable in younger adults and the pandemic may have also had a more negative impact on this age group. Although the pandemic was stressful for everyone, it disrupted the normative tasks of younger adulthood, such as school and the transition into the workforce and being sociable and developing relationships, said Sutin. It is speculative because we did not measure reasons for the change, but this disruption may have had a larger impact on younger adults because these tasks are very important for this age group. The researchers will continue monitoring the cohort to see whether the personality shifts are temporary or more enduring. Its interesting to see this average effect, despite the fact that people must deal with the things going on quite differently, said Prof Wiebke Bleidorn, a psychologist at the University of Zurich, who was not involved in the research. One interpretation is that not having the normal formative experiences put development on hold. It will be interesting to see if ... these traits bounce back. The findings are published in the journal Plos One.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/aug\/06\/capita-boss-credits-remote-working-for-low-covid-related-absences","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/aug\/06\/capita-boss-credits-remote-working-for-low-covid-related-absences","DATE":"2021-08-06 15:50:29","PLAIN_TEXT":"The boss of Capita, one of the UKs largest employers, has credited its policy of allowing staff to continue to work from home for its low levels of absences because of Covid self-isolation alerts. Jon Lewis, the chief executive of the outsourcing firm, said on Friday that a large number of his staff want to continue working from home, either permanently or part-time, in the future. The vast majority of Capitas 43,000 UK employees are still working from home, despite the removal of nearly all restrictions on gatherings in England and the dropping of the governments guidance to work from home where possible. Related: UKs economic recovery from Covid stalled in June amid pingdemic Many companies in sectors across the economy complained of staffing shortages as coronavirus cases rose because the NHSs contact tracing app was pinging large numbers of people with self-isolation requests following contact with someone who later tested positive for the virus. Hospitality, transport and retail companies were particularly hard hit because of workers daily contact with the public. However, fewer than 1% of Capitas workers were self-isolating when app isolation notifications were highest, Lewis told PA Media. That, in some ways, was surprising, Lewis said. I will say we have taken an extraordinarily cautious approach to how we operate the business through the pandemic: 40,000 of our colleagues today continue to work from home, we have very measured and appropriate guidelines in place and a very measured approach to returning to the office. I like to think that helped mitigate a good many of our colleagues being pinged, and therefore, the business impact has been minimal.

A procession moved in slow, measured steps. Their heads were bowed and crowned with ferns. At the centre of the group walked 64 people, each cradling a beige cardboard box. Inside those boxes are the remains of their ancestors, stolen in secret from their graves and kept for more than a century in a Viennese museum. The battle for their return has taken 77 years of negotiations, entreaties and diplomacy. At the ceremony on Sunday, each ancestor was carried inside, placed at the entrance to the marae (meeting house) and gently covered by woven blankets and feathered cloaks. The crowd sang, cried and laughed. Theres a whole range of emotion from anger, contempt, rage, says kaihautu Dr Arapata Hakiwai. But [also] absolute joy and connection and completeness. Because the ancestors have come home. Andreas Reischek, an Austrian taxidermist who stole the remains of 49 people from sacred Maori burial sites. Photograph: Alexander Turnbull Library Grave robbing The story of how they were stolen has taken decades to fully unravel. Its key figure is Andreas Reischek, an Austrian taxidermist who arrived in New Zealand in 1877. He enthusiastically engaged with indigenous Maori and Moriori, winning the trust of the Maori king Tawhiao and permission to roam freely through land. Reischek spent the years that followed carefully locating and surveilling the most sacred sites of his hosts. In secret, he dug up skulls, human remains and treasures from their graves, tucked them into rucksacks, and smuggled them back to Europe to put on display. Reischek was not a blithe offender: in diaries recounting his time in New Zealand he discusses the lengths he took to evade his hosts, as well as how immense the violation was in Maori culture. Went to the east coast where we dug out some Maori skulls ... [my companion] said that if the Maori find out we have skulls in our backpacks they would kill us, I replied he should let me handle that. Took all skulls, he writes in one entry. Robbing the graves, he muses elsewhere, is one of the most difficult tasks, because all these places are tapu, holy, and no one is allowed to enter them, without being noticed by the locals, early morning to evening, especially when theyre mistrusting, he says. These places are sacred and the sinner would be punished with death. All in all, Reischek took the remains of 49 people, proudly shipping them back to Europe to exhibit. Despite an initial lack of interest from Austrian museums, they eventually found their way to the Natural History Museum in Vienna, along with other remains from a handful of other explorers. Related: Long fight for justice ends as New Zealand treaty recognises Moriori people It would be years before most of the tribes discovered the crime, with many finding out only when Reischeks son began translating and publishing fragments of his diaries in 1930. The pain was acute, says Hakiwai: the sheer trauma and shock and grief of knowing that and then sort of coming to terms with it. For Maori, ancestors are not relics of the past - they must remain close by, revered, forming an unbroken connection between past and present. The word that we use for our past is mua, he says. But mua also means ahead. You get a sense: our past is actually in front of us. Our ancestors are connected with us. Almost immediately, iwi (tribes) began calling for their ancestors return. In 1945, as the Maori battalion fought on behalf of the allies in the second world war, they tried unsuccessfully to approach the museum to bring their ancestors home. Decades of repatriation requests were turned down or ignored. In 2017 the museums stance finally began to shift. When the repatriation team visited Vienna that year to again request their return, Prof Sabine Eggers had just started there as head of the international collection. The conversation, she says, had a profound effect. I somehow had the feeling: now Ive been given a mission. Each ancestor was carried inside, placed at the entrance to the marae and gently covered by woven blankets and feathered cloaks. Photograph: Te Papa Eggers began research to discover the provenance of human remains and other artefacts in the collection. She assembled a team to rake through 1,500 pages of Reischeks scrawled, at times unintelligible journals to found out what he had done, and where. We were able to get 1,500 pages of diaries - in horrible handwriting, horrible grammar and so on. We said, OK, lets lets see what he himself wrote about it, she said. This is painstaking work - its unimaginable how much effort and time it costs. In 2020 a formal repatriation request was made again. This time it was granted. Sabine Eggers holds an inventory record relating to one of the ancestral remains taken by Andreas Reischek. Photograph: Christina RittmansbergerNatural History Museum Vienna This week Eggers was there to witness the remains return to their families at Te Papa, New Zealands national museum, which heads up its repatriation program. It has been far too long, she said, offering an apology for the hurt caused. For me, its something scientists should apologise in general - for doing these things in the name of science. We hear our ancestors crying out to be returned The latest repatriation is the largest to take place from Austria but it is one of many that the New Zealand government has been pushing for. In the early 1800s there was a swift trade in Maori remains, particularly tattooed and mummified heads, and up until the 1970s the ancestral remains of Maori and Moriori were traded as curiosities or objects of scientific interest. Today New Zealand is at the forefront of global efforts to repatriate human remains, with a government-mandated team working full-time to bring stolen ancestors home. They have successfully negotiated more than 600 returns - but say there is still a long way to go. We believe that our ancestors are not resting in peace while behind the glass cabinets and in vaults in institutions overseas, says Sir Pou Temara, the repatriation advisory panel chair. We find that repugnant. We hear our ancestors crying out to be returned to New Zealand, and we could feel the satisfaction that they have, in knowing that they were being transported back to where they can rest in peace. Te Arikirangi Mamaku-Ironside, acting head of repatriation, says: Aotearoa is very, very lucky to have a government-funded program that specifically addresses reconciliation through repatriating ancestral human remains. Thats not a luxury that a lot of Indigenous communities have. Related: A turning point: New Zealand museums grapple with return of stolen Maori remains By investing heavily in building relationships with overseas institutions to argue for their ancestors return, they hope to also clear a path for other Indigenous communities to do the same. They look to us as a glimmer of hope, Temara says, for the repatriation of their people in the land that they have grown up in. There is a growing international movement to repatriate Indigenous human remains from international museums. Many museums built collections believing that the cultures and societies they were documenting were on the verge of extinction, Hakiwai says. Now, they find themselves increasingly confronted by the descendants of those they stole from. I think it is really an issue for museums: that they dont acknowledge that there are living and real connections and relationships that exist between the treasures held in these museums, and certainly the ancestral remains, [connections] that are still living in us. I cant see how museums can actually embark in the future unless they really confront and own their past.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/jan\/07\/a-social-care-covenant-how-might-archbishops-plan-work","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/jan\/07\/a-social-care-covenant-how-might-archbishops-plan-work","DATE":"2022-01-07 15:00:25","PLAIN_TEXT":"What is the problem with how we help elderly and disabled people? The quality of life of social care recipients in England is a lottery based on their council area, wealth and the availability of family to offer unpaid care. Social care is means tested and councils do not pay enough to care operators to cover the cost of state-funded recipients, so private funders in effect subsidise them. Standards and availability of care are patchy, families end up bearing a huge burden and people occupy NHS hospital beds when they could be helped in the community. Funding for people who need social care stands at around PS20bn a year compared with PS135bn for the NHS, and the population is ageing. How might Welbys covenant change things? Underwriting social care more fully and setting it alongside education and the NHS as a public good requires, in the archbishops words, making it a national obligation, expressed by the state. That would need wider public acceptance of the merit of improving the quality of life for people nearing the end of their lives, or who are disabled, perhaps by emphasising basic values such as kindness, empathy and justice. Far from everyone will need social care, so a broader state commitment to providing better care is likely to need to be sold by politicians as an insurance policy for all. What approach is the government taking? Its policy announcements have focused more on personal finances than quality of life. The reason for capping care costs at PS86,000 was explained as preventing people having to sell their homes, or in most cases, their children losing a valuable part of their inheritance. Chronic shortages of care staff, which mean about 400,000 people are awaiting care packages or assessments in England, can only be addressed with resources of an additional PS7-PS10bn a year, experts say. Nowhere near that amount is being offered. Does the government have a longer-term vision? The social care white paper, which sets out a 10-year vision, includes elements that could overlap with Welbys hopes. It talks about increasing housing options and spreading innovative community models of care so there is no longer a binary choice between struggling on at home or going into a care home. More intermediate assisted-living options are to be encouraged. This approach could help those who advocate building elderly care into new housing estates and linking care homes with schools to keep the old and young together. A gentler slope between healthy adulthood and death is hoped for.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/mar\/14\/mens-suit-uk-inflation-basket-covid-changes-ons","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/mar\/14\/mens-suit-uk-inflation-basket-covid-changes-ons","DATE":"2022-03-14 09:49:40","PLAIN_TEXT":"The traditional mens suit has been removed from the basket of goods used to calculate the annual inflation rate - the latest casualty of the increase in working from home since the start of the Covid pandemic two years ago. The Office for National Statistics said the change in working patterns meant the suit - ever-present in the basket since its inception in 1947 - was no longer one of the more than 700 representative goods and services selected to measure the UKs cost of living. Announcing details of this years changes, the ONS said a new mens formal jacket or blazer item was being introduced to ensure mens formal and business wear was still represented in the selection.

These included antibacterial surface wipes, sports brascrop tops and collars for dogs and cats. The ONS said demand for antibacterial products was still high, and people had responded to the pandemic by exercising more and owning more pets.

Last year, hand sanitiser, smartwatches and hand weights for home exercise were added. The ONS said this year it had added 19 items, removed 15 and left 715 unchanged. Inflation is at a 30-year-high of 5.5% but is expected to rise further in the coming months as rising energy costs bite. Meat-free sausages were included for the first time. Photograph: Adrian PeacockAlamy Sam Beckett, the ONS head of economic statistics, said: The 2022 basket of goods sees some really interesting changes, with the impact of the pandemic still evident in our shopping habits. With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease. So, mens suits disappear from the basket and are replaced with a formal jacket or blazer. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Last years lockdown living saw an increase in the number of us working out and exercising. That has continued into 2022 with the addition of the sports bra into the basket reflecting greater spending on sports clothing. Responding to criticism from the food writer and campaigner Jack Monroe that the official inflation figure fails to reflect the true cost of living for poorer households, the ONS said it was launching a personal inflation calculator, which could be used to calculate an individuals personal inflation experience based on their spending patterns. The UKs statistical agency also announced it would be using new and improved data sources as part of an attempt to provide a clearer picture of what was happening to prices. It said it was working with retailers to get data straight from their tills, which would include how much each item costs and how many of each type - including value and premium brands - were available from shops in every part of the UK. Beckett said: Todays announcement is a key part of our long-term transformation of prices collection that is designed to keep the measurement of UK inflation as accurate and relevant as possible.

The plan would also oblige employers to respond to such requests more quickly, and is being billed as a major reshaping of the way people work in a post-pandemic world, making flexible work the default. But before the release of the document, unions are warning that the proposals do not go far enough and that rather than obliging people to ask for flexible working, job adverts should set out what sort of options are available for the role. The consultation document, due to be published on Thursday by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis), comes from a wider programme called the Good Work Plan, begun in 2019. It is examining the full range of flexible working, including working fewer or different hours, or so-called compressed hours - working more hours on fewer days - working from home for some or all the time, and job shares. While the proposals have not yet been released, it is understood that the key recommendation will be to allow people to seek flexible working from day one of a job rather than, as now, having to wait for six months. In addition to this, businesses will be obliged to respond to requests quicker than the current maximum of three months. If a request is refused, the employer will need to explain why and suggest an alternative work arrangement. The TUC has said this would not be enough to fulfil the governments manifesto commitment to make flexible working the default option, pointing out that at least some workers have been able to request flexible working under law since 2003, and that beyond the explosion of remote working during Covid, little has changed since then. Sue Coe, the TUCs senior equalities policy officer, said labour force survey statistics showed that between 2013 and 2020 the proportion of people who did any kind of flexible working rose only from 26% to 30%. If you look at that, does it say to you this is a policy thats working but needs a little bit of fine-tuning to make it work? she said. Angela Rayner, Labours deputy leader, said: Labour will give workers the right to flexible working - not just the right to request it - and give all workers full rights from day one on the job. The new normal after this pandemic must mean a new deal for all working people based on flexibility, security and strengthened rights at work. Other statistics showed that one in three requests for flexible working were refused, while research carried out by Beis and the Equalities and Human Right Commission said almost four in 10 employed mothers had not requested some type of flexible working they would like. This was often because they assumed it would be turned down, but many women also said they feared that to work flexibly would damage their careers. What we have always said is that a right to request is a right to be turned down for too many, Coe said. Whats the government is trying to achieve is laudable - to make flexible working the default. But even for people who dont get turned down, what we see all too often is people, particularly women, paying the price for flexible working because it is not the default. Covid had shown how one type of flexible work, working remotely, could be arranged for millions of people almost instantly, Coe said. Of course, you cant work from home if, say, youre a train driver. But what the pandemic has shown us is that flexible working is eminently achievable. What we need is the ambition to make default flexible working a reality rather than this limited fiddling around the edges of a policy that we have already seen has failed. While Beis is not commenting before the consultation is released, officials are understood to believe that the proposals are a sensible attempt to find a balance between the needs of staff and those of employers.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/aug\/21\/staffing-crisis-leaves-many-english-care-home-residents-basic-needs-unmet","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/aug\/21\/staffing-crisis-leaves-many-english-care-home-residents-basic-needs-unmet","DATE":"2022-08-21 15:00:12","PLAIN_TEXT":"Thousands of vulnerable people are suffering inadequate care as severe staffing shortages in previously good care homes push operators to break rules and put residents at risk. A wave of inspections has revealed the human impact of a worsening nationwide staffing crisis, with people being left in their rooms 24 hours a day, denied showers for over a week, enduring assaults from fellow residents, and left soaking in their own urine. Stretched staff have described scrambling to help residents with buzzers going off and fear the squeeze on their time is dangerous. Analysis by the Guardian revealed that staff shortages were identified as a key problem in three-quarters of all the care homes in England where the Care Quality Commission regulator had cut their rating from good before Covid-19 to inadequate this summer. A further 10% of homes whose rankings slumped had enough staff, but failed to recruit safely, either not taking references properly, carrying out criminal records checks, or training staff adequately. Staff shortages rose by 52% in the last year to 165,000 vacancies, according to Skills for Care, and close to one in 10 social care posts in England are now vacant. Examples of comments care workers made to inspectors include staffing is a disaster and because of how intense its been and lack of support, staff just dont want to do it any more. The average hourly pay in independent care homes in England is PS9.01, according to the latest available analysis for 202021. Starbucks baristas earn over PS10 an hour, and Amazon warehouse workers earn a basic wage of PS10-PS12 an hour. Incidents in care homes found to have contributed to breaches of Care Act regulations because of staffing shortages included: A resident at Cedar Lodge care home in Bury St Edmunds - where at times 23 people were left unsupervised - physically and verbally assaulted another. Another person went missing and was only found after a member of the public escorted them to a police station. At Osbourne Court care home in Hertfordshire, staff had so little time, they used wet wipes to clean one resident and only showered and washed their hair once a week. Residents were left in soiled incontinence pads overnight at the Hollies in Westcliff-on-Sea. Workers have been walking out to take less stressful, better-paid jobs in supermarkets, hospitality, hairdressing and factory work, care managers report. Low pay worsened by high inflation and burnout are among the most common reasons given for quitting. Last week, it was reported that the health secretary, Steve Barclay, would try to recruit overseas workers in care homes amid concerns about staff shortages this winter. Inadequate care homes remain a small minority - just 241 homes out of 14,597 registered with the CQC - but a further 2,441 require improvement. Analysis of dozens of inspection reports shows activities being cancelled, residents being left in their rooms for hours, going without water, and waiting bursting for up to 30 minutes to be taken to the toilet. In one home, staff refused a residents request to be helped out of her chair because they were too busy. We havent got time for the residents, admitted one care worker. At one home the lack of staff meant a resident wasnt helped out of bed until 3pm and several others after 12 noon, while at another, the night shift workers started to wake people at 4.45am to help the day staff. In a home with five staff to look after 25 people, a worker told the CQC: You havent got time to finish supporting one person before the other and you have the buzzers going on. Youre rushing them, its dangerous, and its not fair at all. Families said the staffing shortages had reached crisis point. Older people are paying a heavy price for these failings, as poor care robs them of their dignity, breaks their will and makes them feel unsafe in their own home, said Helen Wildbore, director of the Relatives and Residents Association. Older people need much more than empty slogans from the next prime minister about fixing social care. Last years announcement of social care reforms focusing on capping costs for service users have been criticised for failing to address the staffing shortage or increasing pay. In July, 88% of NHS leaders polled said a lack of adequate capacity in social care was having a significant or very significant impact on emergency department pressures. A separate snapshot survey of 45 independent care homes that have lost staff, conducted by the National Care Association (NCA) for the Guardian, found that over half of homes had had to reduce the amount of time staff spend talking to residents and cut back on entertainment and trips out of the home. Despite rising demand because of an ageing population, several managers said more than a quarter of their beds were unused because they lacked the staff to support them. Julys announcement of a PS1,400 pay rise for many NHS nurses has seen more care workers consider switching, said Karolina Gerlich, chief executive of the Care Workers Charity, who is calling for all care workers to be paid at least PS9.90 an hour and PS11.05 in London. The quality of care suffers not because the people that stay arent working hard enough, but because there is only so much one person can do, Gerlich said. Unless we have parity of pay and conditions [with the NHS], this crisis will continue. We cant compete with retail, where pay is more appealing, especially as the cost of living begins to bite, said Nadra Ahmed, executive chairman of the NCA, which represents independent care home operators. Small and medium-sized providers struggle as many are reliant on local authority funding, which remains woefully inadequate. In hospitals, the beds are based on funding of around PS2,000 a week, but in a care setting, the same person warrants around PS650 or less. Vanessa Meggs, registered manager at the Hollies, strongly denied that staff shortages were preventing adequate care. She said her residents who had learning difficulties and schizophrenia wouldnt allow incontinence pads to be changed at night. Jamie Warnock, the registered manager of Cedar Lodge, declined to comment. Four Seasons Health Care, which runs Osbourne Court, said: Following the pandemic, the sector has struggled to recruit across the country, and we continue to invest in hiring and developing talent in our homes. Since the inspection in March, we have reviewed our staffing management systems and installed an experienced senior manager to oversee the home, working closely with the CQC and the local authority to demonstrate that staff receive training, support and leadership. We always maintain safe staffing levels and continue to recruit new team members into the home. The care and support of our residents and colleagues remain our first priority.

And, to clarify: PS9.01 is the average hourly pay in independent care homes in England according to the latest available analysis for 202021, rather than the current average pay.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/aug\/26\/unloved-rented-flat-transformed-into-stylish-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/aug\/26\/unloved-rented-flat-transformed-into-stylish-home","DATE":"2022-08-26 05:00:25","PLAIN_TEXT":"Visit this apartment in the daytime and, with its calming neutrals and lush greenery, youd swear it was designed for tranquil days. But call at cocktail hour and the same space feels deeply decadent, its 1970s bar and vast, butter-coloured sofa perfect for fun evenings. It is also a great advert for how to make a plain, rented flat feel like a home, without major renovations. A first viewing left interior designers Tatjana von Stein and Gayle Noonan distinctly underwhelmed. It was a tired, unloved white box when we found it, Von Stein says of the flat, which occupies the top two floors of a five-storey early 20th-century block in north London. Two bedrooms, a bathroom and the kitchen are on the lower level, while the spacious open-plan living-dining room is above. The main bedroom painted in Tatjana and Gayles own Sella paint shade. Photograph: Gaelle Le Boulicaut The couple fell for the place because of the greenery on the doorstep: a balcony facing Hampstead Heath and, on the other side, wall-to-wall windows on to the tree canopy of neighbouring gardens. I grew up in the mountains in Austria so, although I love the buzz and culture of London, Im very happy up here in this urban treehouse, Von Stein says. I wanted this place to have a 70s lounge feel, but I didnt want it to feel like a themed room Tatjana von Stein As renters, the couple renovated with a light touch, relying on paint and furniture. Renting is much more common in Europe, so it doesnt feel strange to me, but it does mean Gayle can put the brakes on me going crazy on a redesign, Von Stein says. To transform a rental with furniture, she suggests beginning with the mood. I wanted this place to have a 70s lounge feel, but I didnt want it to feel like a themed room, so theres a mix of vintage and contemporary pieces along with things weve made or inherited. A burr wood sconce light in the kitchen. Photograph: Gaelle Le Boulicaut She combines eras and styles by sticking to specific materials, textures, colours and forms. Warm woods feature heavily, from her own-design Pontem dining table to the Biedermeier writing desk, which belonged to Von Steins grandmother. Curves are everywhere, from the velvet club chairs by Spanish designer Houtique to the stainless-steel Willy Rizzo coffee table and Von Steins own Ladies Pond bar stool. Von Stein has smart advice for laying out an open-plan room. It can feel daunting, so start with whats important to you - a piece of art, or a favourite table. Find the perfect spot to place it and then work around that. In Von Steins case, the focal point is a sofa by Fest Amsterdam, upholstered in beeswax-coloured wool from Rose Uniacke. Around this area, the other zones took shape: the long table, used for dining, working and reading, is bathed in the light from the angled windows, and close to the stairs down to the kitchen, with the couples record player and vinyl collection on hand too. The cocktail bar - which Von Stein had reveneered in a burr wood - is perfectly placed by the balcony, for drinks at sunset. The spaces between these main zones feature art - a wooden sculpture that Von Stein found in Paris; an old faux marble (actually painted wood) classical pot and plinth inherited from her uncle - and large, lush indoor plants, including Strelitzia nicolai and Monstera deliciosa. Von Stein likes to throw in some playful touches too, like the kitschy 1950s-style resin lamp on the bar. Id be bored if it was too serious. You just need to add a little wink to every room, she says. The 1970s cocktail bar reveneered in burr wood. Photograph: Gaelle Le Boulicaut A shared passion for design was part of this couples story from the start. They met in 2013 when they were both working for a concept store in London. We each had a slight obsession with chairs and started bombarding one another with pictures of them, Von Stein laughs. When they founded their design studio in 2016, they named it Sella Concept, using the Latin word for chair. They married in 2018 in an outdoor ceremony at a remote farm in Andalucia. In the living room, the quest for the perfect paint colour led to a collaboration with Mylands, and the creation of Sella, a warm neutral shade with hints of yellow. To choose the right paint you need to consider room size and the amount of light; in a small dark room Ill often go dark and indulgent, to play with what the room is giving you. Here theres a lot of light so I wanted to calm that down. Whatever the room size, Von Stein advises painting the ceiling in the same colour, for a more immersive effect: Theres a feeling of being enveloped in what youve created. Related: Let there be light: a radically revamped 1980s home In the kitchen, Von Stein repainted the existing cabinets in Mylands avocado-hued Stockwell Green and swapped in new stainless-steel handles and striped blinds in a fabric from Spanish fabric maker Guell Lamadrid. When youre renting, its about working out which changes will make the biggest difference to the space, to make it feel like its yours, Von Stein says.Living in the flat has been a positive experience all round. I travel a lot for work and coming home now gives me a real sense of peace, she says. Its a space for us to enjoy alone, or with friends. And being surrounded by greenery is incredibly nourishing: it all feels like a weekend away in the countryside, but still a stones throw away from Londons energy.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2023\/jan\/26\/readers-uk-cost-of-living-crisis","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2023\/jan\/26\/readers-uk-cost-of-living-crisis","DATE":"2023-01-26 16:00:25","PLAIN_TEXT":"As the cost of living crisis rages and UK inflation remains at one of the highest levels in 40 years, many people are finding that even the most meticulous budgeting can no longer make up for astronomical price rises in many areas of life. Here, four people from different parts of the country share why they have had to take more drastic cost-cutting measures to stay financially afloat. Ive moved my whole family into my mums small attic Marc, 37, an office worker in the food industry from Salford, was faced with an impossible choice last July when his landlord said the rent would have to nearly double. He said he would offer a generous increase from PS800 to PS1,400, from October, he says. At that point, my utilities alone were costing me about 500 quid a month. The sums just didnt add up. After seeing that rents in the area were similar for comparable properties, Marc decided to give up the rented four-bed family home and has since moved his wife and three children, aged 5, 11 and 12, into an attic space in his mothers house close by. Ive had to borrow PS15k to make the attic livable. Ive put windows in, a shower, plumbing, and electrics. Living with my mother is not something I want to do, at almost 40, but otherwise Id have to stop eating just to pay for housing costs, which would have been PS2,200 monthly had we stayed, Marc says. Putting the money towards a house purchase would have been out of the question, as it would have taken 15 to 20 years, Marc estimates, to get a 25% deposit together. I havent measured how much space we have now, but its not a lot. The master bedroom is roughly as big as two kingsize beds pushed together; the other sleeping quarters are much smaller. We share the kitchen with my mum downstairs. Although the family is relieved to have escaped some of the financial pressure, the move has put considerable strain on everyone. Its not been easy sailing, this move has been based on trade-offs. Ive given up significant privacy, I cant do what I want. My 22-year-old sister is also living here. One of my kids, my son, has taken the move hard. Hes complaining about a lack of space, a lack of freedom. How long the family will stay in the attic remains unclear, Marc says. I want to pay off the loans, which could take between two and five years. Then we can explore further. My daughter is sleeping in her winter coat this year Vicky Page, 51, is working in near freezing temperatures to keep on top of her familys bills. Photograph: Vicky PageGuardian Community Vicky Page, who lives in Warwickshire and works for an environmental charity, says the family has had to switch the heating off almost entirely this winter despite working from home and having young children. I work in my north-facing conservatory - the only room with space for a full-sized desk - and this year Ive had to turn the heating off completely. Im wearing three jumpers, two pairs of trousers. I also have a heated mat on the floor for my feet, and a heated mouse mat - a little furry cave you can slip your hand into to keep warm. Today it was 2C in there when I started work. I sit shivering in this room six hours a day. While the family is able to heat the living room with the help of a mini wood-burning stove to about 15C, her childrens bedrooms upstairs are much colder, she says. My 11-year-old daughter sleeps with a winter coat and three blankets on top. Were not destitute, but electricity prices have tripled and we have to be very careful. I gave up my plans to adopt For Natasha, a full-time civil servant from Leeds paid PS30,800 a year, many smaller cost-cutting exercises over the past year failed to generate enough savings and forced her to make bigger, life-changing decisions to create financial wriggle room. In November my energy bills rose to PS175 a month. My flat has very old heaters which are really expensive to run. I work from home and have requested to go in more, but Im only allowed in once a week due to limited office space, the 34-year-old says. When cancelling subscriptions, cutting out meat from her diet, buying a box of 600 teabags on offer and sleeping with a hat on did not bring her costs down sufficiently, Natasha decided more drastic action was necessary. I was looking to adopt so I moved to a two-bed flat in March, she says. But Ive had to put that on hold indefinitely because of my financial uncertainty. I read about one-room living, and created one room for living, working and sleeping. Hopefully only having to heat one room will generate enough savings. I have a Cpap machine for sleep apnea and Ive started using it every other night, I dont know what else to do to cut spiralling costs. I used to spend PS25 a week on groceries. Last week my usual shop came to PS60, so I had to put things back. Its a shock when, as a middle-income earner, I have to give up some food so I can afford sanitary products. I have to give up my career in London and move back home Pre-pandemic, Eileen, in her 50s, had a relatively comfortable life in London, taking home about PS40,000 a year as a theatre makeup technician. Ive lived here for 35 years, but now I can no longer afford to. Its no longer working for me, and pushing me into debt, she says. Eileen is single, lives alone, and pays PS1,100 a month for her mortgage for her one-bedroom flat, which is due to go up again. My bills are PS1,800 monthly, leaving me with about PS600 for food and everything else. I watch every flipping penny, buy mostly tinned food now, never go out - but you just cant keep up with inflation, and run out of money. Two weeks into a month I have to use my credit card. I can no longer afford going to the dentist. Ive built up about PS7,000 of debt since the pandemic. Eileen has come to the bitter conclusion that continuing in her career of 30 years is no longer financially sustainable. Im experienced and highly skilled, but the last time I was this hard up was when I was a student in the late 1980s. Id be better off working at Marks &amp; Spencer and owning a house outright back in my home town in Nottinghamshire - even on universal credit I would be better off. Many colleagues feel the same; everyones become really demotivated. Im going to sell up and move back home. London is no longer this place of great opportunity - its become unliveable, for so many of us.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2021\/jun\/21\/working-from-home-has-its-benefits-for-employers","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2021\/jun\/21\/working-from-home-has-its-benefits-for-employers","DATE":"2021-06-21 16:40:11","PLAIN_TEXT":"Your report that HSBC is planning to cut its global office footprint by 40% as a result of requiring its staff to work from home is somewhat misleading (Morgan Stanley boss tells US staff to be back in office in September, 15 June). In reality, what HSBC and a host of other companies are planning to do is cut the cost of their office footprint by transferring the square footage they pay for in town and city centres to the homes of their staff. So the total office space such companies use is not reduced, it is simply transferred, along with the cost, to the staff who are required to work from home. The implication, of course, is that HSBC et al will enjoy enormous cost savings in terms of rents, building maintenance and, not least of all, business rates, by moving commercial premises to residential settings. Quite apart from issues of planning (ie, residential premises being used for commercial purposes), there is the question of whether someone who uses their home officially for business purposes should be paying towards the shortfall in business rates that local authorities will lose out on as businesses vacate their citytown centre premises - not to mention the knock-on effect on service industries that depend on office workers for their livelihood. Also, who pays for cleaning the homeoffice space that employees use on behalf of their employer? Presumably the employee. There is also the question of insurance. What happens if an employee trips on a computer cable and injures themselves while working at home? Is this a domestic or industrial accident? Which insurance policy will agree to pay? What happens if an electrical fault in a work computer triggers a fire in someones home? Whose insurance policy pays for the damage? We have seen with the big tech companies that technology outstrips current legislation on tax, health and safety, employment law and so on. The gig economy has already endured an enormous shift of cost and risk from employer to employee. We need to ensure that the shift from office to home working does not continue this process at the expense of employees health, safety and prosperity, and of the interests of the wider community.Terry KellyWidnes, Cheshire * I was pleased to hear that Boris Johnson is now taking a more cautious approach and workers will not be discouraged from continuing to work from home (Ministers will not tell workers to return to office when lockdown ends, 17 June). However, given that working from home reduces carbon emissions, surely it makes sense for as many people as possible to work from home at least some of the time? It will help us move towards our zero-carbon goal. Even if we travel to work using electric vehicles powered from renewable sources, there is still likely to be an environmental cost, as explained by Thea Riofrancos (The rush to go electric comes with a hidden cost: destructive lithium mining, 14 June).Janet PoliakoffNottingham * Your print headline PM will not issue order for return to offices is extremely disturbing.

As coronavirus restrictions lift, many companies whose staff have worked from home for 18 months are asking those workers to dust off their bras and smart trousers and return to the office part-time. While the majority of people will be given little choice about where they work (the proportion of people working from home more than doubled in 2020, but was still only a quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics), many companies that have used remote working are now expecting staff to work more flexibly. Recent research from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) found that about half of managers expected staff to be in the office two to three days a week, while 48% of managers feared team members could quit if they could no longer work remotely. As employees face the prospect of the new 3:2 working diet, what are the best ways for companies and their workers to ensure they can step with confidence into this brave new world? Welcome to the revolution Experts agree there is no one-size-fits-all model for hybrid working. While some companies are insisting on a set number of days a week in the office, or even full-time if you work for Goldman Sachs, others such as Tui are stipulating a minimum of one day a month. Ann Francke, the chief executive of the CMI, argues that the most successful models will be the most flexible ones. Command and control isnt the way we work now, the pandemic has knocked presenteeism on its head. Work should be output-focused - about what you do, not where you do it, she says. Employees facing a set number of days - and able to choose them - should consider their home commitments, says Dr Heejung Chung, an expert in flexible working and reader in sociology at the University of Kent. Fitting your schedule into your work-life balance demands will enhance performance outcomes, she says. Workers may want to consider whether their partner will be in the office on certain days, and whether a quieter house to work in might be preferable, says Kristal McNamara, the founder of WorkWell Bristol, a flexible and hybrid working management consultancy. Its all about planning, she says, and that includes planning who is going to put the washing on now that it cant be fitted around a Zoom call. If one of you is physically at work more often, you still need to plan for the fact that looking after the house is a joint responsibility. Companies may want to consider creating social activities that do not involve Friday night drinks, which already exclude many workers, says Louise Ware, the COO of Fyxer, a fully remote company that recently asked all employees to share their best photos of summer and vote for their favourite. We had massive engagement - you get to see a snapshot of someone elses life and get to know everybody, but its also really low-energy, takes little time and is inclusive. Make flexible fair Jo Burkill, of the flexible working specialists Timewise, says companies have to be very conscious of the risk of creating a two-tier hybrid system if days are not fixed, with managers and wannabe leaders going into the office while those with caring responsibilities, disabilities or anxieties are shut out at home. If we dont find a way to make sure part-time workers - the majority of whom are women - are considered, we really do face a real risk of losing a whole generation of talent, Burkill says. Amy Butterworth, a consultant at Timewise, adds that companies should ensure that people dialling in to meetings are invited, visible and given time to speak. Its about awareness and at every step thinking how am I making sure that everyone is involved. If you want more time at home but dont want your career to stall, there are simple ways to stay in the line of sight, says Francke, such as turning on your camera and increasing written communications outlining what you are doing and where, as well as flagging your achievements. Time to get organised Chaotic workers are going to have to raise their organisational game for hybrid working, says Prof Cary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. If youre not a good organiser of yourself and your time, youre in trouble, he says. Tech solutions such as open diaries, workplace booking systems such as Condeco or desk-organising software such as GoBright will help, says McNamara. Nobody should be having to email an administrator to change a spreadsheet when their plans change, she says. Get in the zone Recent CMI research found that two-thirds of workers had some anxiety about returning to the office. Recognising that people have different levels of readiness and giving them space to talk is very important, says Francke. Cooper argues that giving workforces greater flexibility will improve mental health and productivity. According to the Health and Safety Executive, stress, depression and anxiety accounted for 51% of all work-related sickness and 55% of all sick days in 2019-20. The evidence, globally, is clear: if employers and employees agree to flexible working you have higher job satisfaction, less sickness absence days and higher productivity where you can measure it, he says. In the hybrid world, a workers most important asset will be a good manager, he adds. If you have a manager with empathy and social interpersonal skills, it will work.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2023\/feb\/14\/we-live-in-the-here-and-now-ukrainian-refugees-starting-businesses-in-the-uk","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/feb\/14\/we-live-in-the-here-and-now-ukrainian-refugees-starting-businesses-in-the-uk","DATE":"2023-02-14 08:00:31","PLAIN_TEXT":"Alex and Ivanna Maliks car journey from their home in the devastated eastern Ukraine frontline to a sleepy Berkshire village took them through five countries. With their two children and the possessions they could fit loaded into the car, they traced a route through Moldova and over the snowy mountain passes of Romania, following a route picked out on Google Maps on their phones. They first stopped in Germany. We thought the war wouldnt be too long, maybe a month or two, says Ivanna. But I dont speak German, Alex doesnt speak German, so they decided to move on and, with the help of a British volunteer they found on Facebook, were offered a refuge by an incredible couple who had a little space to spare. Alex speaks barely a word of English, but Ivanna can get by fairly well - and they are acutely aware that this ability of hers has made all the difference to their prospects in Britain. They are now running an IT business, RepairServiceUK, which has enough clients to support the family. The pair are among the more than 157,000 people who have come to Britain from Ukraine in the almost one year since the Russian invasion under the governments visa schemes. Some have been able to get their lives back on track quickly as, unlike the majority of refugees arriving in the UK, Ukrainians have the right to work as soon as they arrive. While some Ukrainians in the UK are now thriving like the Maliks, others have struggled. They have a friend who was a director of a company back home who is now in London. She is a good [businesswoman], but she doesnt know English, and so - aged 45 and with children to support - she took a job as a hotel housekeeper. Its hard when you were a director and then you go to a cleaning job, says Ivanna. If you know you want to emigrate, maybe you learn English, [save] some money. For our people, we [didnt] have a choice, it was like ...  She mimes her sweater being yanked by an unseen hand. The pair are also lucky to be able to work in the same area as they did in Ukraine. While 56% of adults surveyed by the Office for National Statistics in November were working, 65% of those were not in the same sector as back home in Ukraine. Half said it had been difficult taking up work in the UK, with language the major factor. And yet, says Ivanna: We dont sit at home. Ukraine is not a rich country, and we work every day, every day. For our people, this is a normal situation. We go to work. Back home in Mykolaiv, Alex Malik had a large IT service business with about 20,000 clients that he had built from scratch. Now all I have is my memories, he says. They are a warm couple who laugh frequently, but it has clearly been a huge challenge starting again with nothing. Repeated requests to their local jobcentre for a little help to print business cards or A4 posters were rebuffed, they say, though one or two individuals helped them out with some basic materials, which they have stuck on bus shelters and in local cafes, or a little advertising space. Related: Ukrainian refugees and hosts petition UK government for housing support With this and through word of mouth in their village (where the many elderly residents need help with IT), RepairServiceUK has grown quickly. But because only Ivanna can speak English, every job or visit must be done together while the children are at school. They will shortly move into nearby Reading, where they were eventually able to find a private landlord willing to rent to them (Alex said: We are from Ukraine, dont be afraid of us, please.) What would help? Twenty-five hours in the day, says Alex. He usually works until 2am, often on Zoom helping people back home with IT problems for free. But there is a lot they try not to think about. I have 20,000 clients at home but hundreds of them have been killed - by shrapnel bombs, killed in shelling of our city, says Alex. And I get messages from their families like this: Hello Alex, this is Anatolys wife, I would like to inform you that he died. Imagine, I pick up my phone in the morning, open [the instant messaging service] Viber, and read this. I mean, it makes you go crazy. So we dont think about anything. We just work and live in the here and now. With many Ukrainian men joining the military, significantly more working-age women than men have come to the UK - they make up 49% of the total, compared to 15% of men (under-18s accounted for 31%, with the remaining 5% aged 65 and over). For Nataliia Horbenko, moving to north London from Kyiv last year to set up a business in Britain was her contribution to the war effort. I am a soldier, not at the frontline of the war, but at the economic front. My aim is to increase the economy of my homeland of Ukraine, and I think I could be successful in this task. Back home she was a logistics manager in a transport company and she speaks passionately (I belong to business - I like logistics) about the opportunity she saw to do her bit. Nataliia Horbenko with her clothes featuring Ukrainian motifs. Photograph: Graeme RobertsonThe Guardian We [Ukrainians] needed to make a decision and be very brave, but we had no choice, she said. We need to keep our minds very clear, be focused and do what we are good at. Im good at logistics. So why couldnt I help my Ukraine and also be helpful for your country by paying taxes here? It will be mutual cooperation. She has started a branch of the logistics firm in Britain, and is trying to develop it as a business - while exploring importing Ukrainian products including sunflower oil, pastries and furniture. A lot of villages in Ukraine already are suppliers to Ikea. And if Ikea choose us as a supplier, why cant we find clients here in the United Kingdom? Back home before the war, Horbenko enjoyed designing and making clothes, but it was just a personal passion. But when I came here, I started thinking that Id need to do everything, because London is a very expensive city. I need to be very, very, very active. So she is now also a fashion designer, emailing her orders to a colleague in central Ukraine who makes garments embroidered with elaborate Ukrainian designs. At the same time, she is working with a film producer on what she hopes will be a series of documentaries about the impact of the war. My aim is to show businessmen in the world, a portrait of Ukrainian businessmen. We are really very brave. We are resilient, we are entrepreneurial, we talk with passion. Having found enormously supportive hosts and neighbours in Islington, Horbenko is aware she has been very lucky - in part because she arrived as a single person. Her father is still in Ukraine, but I have no place at this moment to invite him and support him in the UK. Its very difficult for old people to just adapt to the situation abroad - its a different world. So I dont know what will be his future. They talk very frequently, always determinedly focusing on the positive, she says. It just helps us to be resilient. So we try to be focused, and speak about positive things about the future, about what we will do after the war ends. It keeps our minds alive. Mykola Zinchenko, formerly of Kyiv, now living in Aberdeen, loves the friendliness of his new city, but there are aspects of its culture that he cannot understand. The surprising thing is that people wear T-shirts when its five degrees. We are wrapped up in sweaters and jackets, and you see a guy walking down the street in a T shirt. He grins. That is a surprise. Art dealer Mykola Zinchenko at the Aberdeen Art Gallery. Photograph: Murdo MacLeodThe Guardian Having left Ukraine with his wife and young daughter last May, they came first to Edinburgh, then East Kilbride before being offered a flat in the city he affectionately describes as 50 shades of grey. Aspects of their new life are like a dream come true, Zinchenko says - they even have a sea view from their flat - but this is no holiday. Zinchenko was an art dealer in Ukraine, and he was determined to get established as soon as they arrived in Scotland, he says. At the hotel where they were originally placed, everyone was waiting. A lot of people were struggling, suffering after the war. In contrast, I asked for a meeting room. So for a time I had my little office in the hotel, and people went: Oh, what is he doing there? I tried to continually [stay busy]. Eight months later he is making a little headway, having exhibited some works at the Aberdeen Art Fair and been asked to participate in another major fair in Glasgow in May. Most of his work is by Ukrainian artists, but he has recently signed up to represent his first Scottish artist and he says he is looking around, exploring the opportunities, while working on a PhD back home via Zoom. I want more, he says. The future, though, is entirely unclear. When the old year ends, every 31 December, I used to always make a plan for the future. This year it was really hard. Because the life that we had, the plans that Ive had for several years in Ukraine, I see that now they are [gone]. I need to make another plan.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/jun\/14\/companies-keener-on-return-to-uk-offices-than-staff-surveys-say","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/jun\/14\/companies-keener-on-return-to-uk-offices-than-staff-surveys-say","DATE":"2021-06-14 18:48:51","PLAIN_TEXT":"Plans by City banks to bring thousands of workers back to the office are in disarray after Boris Johnson postponed a lifting of lockdown restrictions. Guidelines encouraging people to continue to work from home if you can in England were due to be dropped on 21 June, but that move will now be delayed by four weeks. The corporate world has become increasingly split over home working but across the City, major banks had planned to welcome more staff into offices from next week. They included Goldman Sachs, whose boss David Solomon has criticised remote working as an aberration and called for a return to offices as soon as government guidance allowed. About 30% of its 6,000 London staff are currently filing into the London office, where workers are tested twice a week by more than a dozen on-site medical staff. Plans to further boost office attendance at the US investment bank are now in doubt following the UK governments delay. NatWest, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Deutsche Bank were also expected to bring more staff in from next week but are now prepared to tell employees to wait until work from home orders are lifted. The prime ministers announcement on Monday evening came as an official study showed that company bosses are more keen than their staff for a return of workers to UK offices after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said more than a third of people working from home - 36% - thought they would keep the arrangement for most of the week. However, there is less enthusiasm among managers, with as few as 24% of companies planning to use increased home working in future. Based on the answers of thousands of workers and businesses surveyed by government statisticians in the past two months, the study signalled that a high degree of uncertainty still remains as employers weigh up their options. More than a quarter of firms still do not know what they will do. Related: Five-day week in office could return soon, says UK thinktank According to the snapshot from the ONS, more flexibility for workers is expected in future, amid a sharp rise in online job adverts where home working is mentioned. But while the pandemic has accelerated remote-working practices, the early survey evidence suggests it will remain in the minority. Most people did not work from home during the pandemic, according to the figures, despite a larger proportion in London and the south-east, in IT and professional jobs, and in high-paying roles working remotely. The proportion of working adults who did any work from home rose to 37% on average last year from 27% in 2019. While this figure fluctuated in line with lockdown restrictions, most people continued to travel to work. Home working graphic Separate figures from the AlphaWise research unit of Morgan Stanley show British workers have increasingly been spending more time at their desks in the past few months. Reflecting a gradual return to work after lockdown, UK office-based staff were spending almost half (46%) of their time at their usual workplace in late May, the highest level in six months. Most UK employees expect to return to their workplace during August, compared with an average expectation of mid-July in the five countries surveyed. AlphaWise said office workers across Europe want to continue to work from home for on average two days a week. On average, UK workers would like to work remotely for roughly half of the working week, 2.3 days, slightly higher than in Europe. Although British workers have started returning to offices in greater numbers, the research showed the UK still lags behind France, Germany, Italy and Spain for office-based staff returning to their usual workplace. According to the ONS, as many as 85% of staff currently working from home want a hybrid approach of both office and home working in future. Businesses also expect to use such practices in future but expect most of their staff to be in the office. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Higher-income workers are more likely to expect they will continue with a hybrid mix of working from home and the office in future compared with lower-paid staff. Younger workers expect to return to their normal place of work sooner than older employees. IT and communications businesses are most likely to offer home working in future. Hugh Stickland of the ONS said: While many workers clearly prefer working from home, todays research suggests their bosses remain unconvinced. Clearly, it is much easier to work from home when offering IT support than it is when running a cafe, which is virtually impossible. However, the increased mentions of home working in jobs adverts shows at least some employers coming around to the new normal.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/jan\/25\/older-americans-struggle-find-work-covid-retirement","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/jan\/25\/older-americans-struggle-find-work-covid-retirement","DATE":"2022-01-25 10:00:20","PLAIN_TEXT":"Elaine Simons, a 61-year-old substitute art teacher in the Seattle, Washington area, was on a 10-month contract and hoping to settle into a more permanent role at the school where she was teaching when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the US in March 2020. Her school shut down for the remainder of the school year, with Simons having to pack up her classroom and learn to navigate the technology necessary to teach remotely. In June 2020, Simons was informed her teaching contract would not be renewed. Some 5.7 million workers ages 55 or older lost their jobs in the US in March and April 2020, 15% of workers in an age demographic that has also experienced the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths. The unemployment rate for workers ages 65 and older hit a record rate of 7.5% in 2020. Simons was able to find a summer teaching position but had to file for unemployment assistance before the fall 2020 school year began. Since then, she has switched back and forth between taking periods of substitute teaching jobs whenever theyre available, and reverting to unemployment during periods where shes been unable to find work. She found, despite claims of substitute teacher shortages, that longer term substitute contract positions werent being offered, and older workers at higher risk for Covid-19 like herself arent willing to take substitute gigs day by day, at various different schools without any compensation for quarantine if they catch or are exposed to Covid-19. Simons is fully vaccinated and boosted, but still worried about catching Covid-19 and exposing her elderly mother, whom she helps care for. Some like myself are too young to retire, so Im still looking for that dream job, I want my permanent job. I want to be fully set for my pension and my social security, said Simons, who cannot afford to retire early because the social security benefits would be far too low to live on. Even with unemployment, Simons has had to rely on food banks, food donations, and mutual aid with neighbors. She has tried to get ahead on bills in anticipation of receiving no income if her unemployment benefits expire and shes unable to obtain a new substitute contracting position, which has been more difficult as many employment resources offered to the unemployed, such as job counseling and training, have been limited during the pandemic. Im sad that at almost 62 years old, I dont see the likelihood of getting employment at this point, added Simons. Its really hard for people in my age bracket. I think that were feeling undervalued. Were feeling missed. Nobody seems to care that were also part of the high risk community. The unemployment rate has tumbled dramatically since the height of the pandemic but older workers are still struggling to find work despite all the reports of worker shortages. Jerry Jenkins, 63, of Lehigh Acres, Florida, lost his job at a manufacturing plant in 2021, where he had worked for seven years. With Floridas maximum unemployment benefits among the lowest in the US, at $275 a week, Jenkins was forced to cash in part of his retirement savings as he is still trying to find another job. Im losing my retirement because no one will hire me. I cant even get anybody to answer my resumes, said Jenkins. Ive even tried to go back to some of the jobs Ive had in my past to get rehired, but no one seems to be interested because I only have two or three years before retirement. He expressed frustrations with the touting of falling unemployment rates, given he and millions of other workers arent classified as in the labor force in part due to expired unemployment benefits. A June 2021 analysis by economists at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School found at least 1.7 million more older workers than expected retired due to the pandemic. The analysis encouraged policy solutions such as expanding Medicare eligibility to the age of 50, expanding social security benefits, and creating a department dedicated to older workers at the US Department of Labor. Monique Morrisey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, explained there are differences among affected older workers, with 55 to 64 year olds who are not eligible for Medicare and in most cases are not yet receiving social security, and workers 65 and older who left the workforce. The issues facing late middle age workers are more worrisome, given their economic demographics. Among this younger group, the job losses are concentrated among non-college educated workers in lower paid jobs and are disproportionately also jobs that have high contact with the public, said Morrissey. Its a lot harder to get another job when youre an older worker. A survey published by AARP in May 2021 found 78% of workers ages 40 to 65 reported either seeing or experiencing age discrimination in the workplace, the highest level found by AARP since they began surveying the question in 2003. More than half of jobseekers over the age of 55 were classified as unemployed for longer than 27 weeks in early 2021. As of October 2021, older workers were the furthest behind in employment recovery among age demographics. Beverly Matozzo of Deptford, New Jersey, worked about 12 hours a week at a school cafeteria for seven years, but was laid off once the school year ended last summer and she hasnt been able to return as she is recovering from a knee injury and from Covid-19. Matozzo, 73, filed for unemployment, but has yet to receive any compensation because the office that assisted in filing her claim made an error with her working dates and she hasnt been able to get the state unemployment agency to fix the problem and get her claim paid out. She has also been locked out of her account and still trying to resolve that issue. I have been told a thousand different things. All I want is my 17 weeks of unemployment, which is what I am owed, said Matozzo. Ive had to have three shots in my knee, walked with crutches for several weeks, and now Ive just gotten over Covid. I just want to be with people. I enjoyed being around the kids, they make you feel alive and fun, so as soon as I can, Im going back. 57-year-old Dawn Leeson of Springhill, Florida, ran a nonprofit after-school program before Covid-19 forced her to shut down the program in March 2020, and she contracted Covid around the same time as her son was hospitalized in New Orleans. She receives social security disability benefits, which arent enough to survive on, and limits her options for new work. My job is still not available. Ive looked a little bit even though Im not ready to go into the workforce because of my fears of Covid. Im high risk and so is my partner, said Leeson. I know at this point I dont have a lot of options. Who is going to want someone who is disabled and 57? Leesons unemployment benefits were cut off in September 2021 when federal extended unemployment benefits ended without any further extensions, after it took her months to start receiving benefits due to long delays and backlogs. She has gone from having zero debt to accumulating about $10,000 in credit card debt in order to make ends meet over the past several months. I barely leave my home, so I dont have gas and car expenses. We eat cheaply. Ive lost 5lbs mainly by eating just a sandwich for dinner most nights, added Leeson. I made it through the holidays, but Im really scared about what comes next.

The decision to quit was the climax of a reckoning that began at the start of the pandemic when she was first laid off from a job she had been in for three years. Ive always had the attitude of being a really hard worker, Lynn said, explaining that she believed her skills made her indispensable to this company. That really changed for me because I realized you could feel totally capable and really important when, really, youre expendable. Related: The Great Resignation has employers sweating. Its time to escalate the pressure | Erika Rodriguez A few months after being laid off, Lynn, who wished to be referred to by just her first name for fear of professional repercussions, got a job as a diagnostic technician for a solar company in Massachusetts. After a year at the company, work started to become an endless cycle of stress. Her company was in the process of eliminating her department and was trying to decrease her pay. I just needed out, she said. Lynn is one of the millions of Americans who have experienced a tectonic shift in their outlook to work during the pandemic. In September, 4.4 million people - more than the population of Oregon - quit their jobs. Job openings have surpassed 10m since the beginning of summer. Workers have been going on strikes and speaking out about their working conditions online, particularly on the popular subreddit rAntiwork, which has more than a million members. Quit my job last night, it was nice to be home to make the kids breakfast and take them to school today, one Reddit user wrote on a post that has received more than 267,000 upvotes. I may not have health insurance, but I feel so free! another user wrote in a post that included screenshots of their resignation via text message. To experts who study the history and cultural role of work in the US, the fact that this moment occurred during the pandemic is largely unsurprising. Millions of Americans have long been exhausted by harsh working conditions - long hours, low pay and little flexibility - and many, especially those who were considered essential workers, have been burnt out by the pandemic. People are saying that they are systematically underpaid, they get a ridiculously low share of the value that they produce over the course of the day. Theyre doing most of the work, and yet theyre treated badly and receive wages that they cannot live on, said Kathi Weeks, an associate professor of womens studies at Duke University and author of The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics, and Postwork Imaginaries. The pandemic was the straw that broke the camels back. Benjamin Hunnicutt, a historian at the University of Iowa who has studied the role that work plays in the lives of Americans for decades, describes it as a mass re-evaluation of the promise that a job can be more than a means to an end and can deeply fulfill us as human beings. Work as we know it is a modern invention, Hunnicutt points out, a product of the Industrial Revolution. The revolution separated work life from home life and made it a distinct part of peoples lives. While the payoff for society was huge, it also made work the dominant factor in our lives, with some people working over 70 hours and having fewer days off. Hunnicutt notes that progress in the early 20th century was defined as higher wages and shorter working hours. Notable economists predicted that this trend would continue and people would work less. The famed economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that by 2030, people would be working 15-hour work weeks. Free time was seen as that place where human beings could flourish, Hunnicutt said. Work was good, but its still a means to an end - the end being making a living and the promise of free time to enrich life so that we become better parents, better participants in our community. Instead, we have been stuck at the same 40-hour workweek that came out of the Great Depression. Why we have not budged from that schedule, despite technology that has made workers far more productive, is a question that Hunnicutt says his research from the last 50 years has been trying to answer. Since the 40-hour workweek was developed over 80 years ago, Americans have developed an almost religious devotion to work, Hunnicutt argues, one where work is seen as an end itself and is fraught with expectations. Our expectation is that work will continue to be full time and it will be that place where our humanity can be fulfilled, he said. But while Americans were raised on the idea of a dream job, one that could be both personally and financially fulfilling, work has often fallen short of providing people with what they need to live. A statue of Elena the Essential Worker at a One Fair Wage and the Poor Peoples Campaign rally in Washington earlier this year. Photograph: Leigh VogelUPIRexShutterstock There is a huge gap between the productivity of workers over the last 40 years and the amount that wages have grown during the same time. Wages today offer workers the same purchasing power that they had in 1979, with the highest tenth of wage earners seeing the most meaningful rise in wages each year. About 43 million Americans have student loan debt worth a total of $1.7tn. Gig and contract work, which typically comes without health insurance or retirement benefits, has risen 15% over the last decade. Even before the pandemic, the reality for many millennials is that they will be financially worse off than their parents, having less wealth than previous generations, largely because of the rising cost of houses and student debt. This reality has created a disillusionment with work among young Americans that Hunnicutt said had been observed before the pandemic but had also been exacerbated by it. The experience of being away from work has awakened people, Hunnicutt said. There are other things to do - there are walks to take in the park, theres life beyond work that [people] had not thought about before. Companies have caught on to the decreasing tolerance for work - particularly work with long hours and bad conditions - and have indicated they are willing to implement some change. Dozens of companies have announced they will allow their employees to work remotely indefinitely. Some companies, like Kickstarter and Shopify, are experimenting with four-day workweeks, which some argue does not affect productivity while increasing employee satisfaction. Policy action at the federal level, while limited, suggests lawmakers have been paying attention. Paid family and medical leave, while under heavy debate in Congress, made their way into a major spending bill passed by the House on Friday. Mark Takano, a US representative from California, has introduced a bill for a 32-hour workweek. Some experts say the phenomenon is temporary, a product of a hot labor market that is empowering workers, and things will eventually go back to the way things were. But others are hopeful that the pandemic has permanently shifted the way that people think about work and will inspire them to question - and even change - the role it plays in our lives. Weeks said that she is excited that so many people are active on the rAntiwork subreddit, and that they seem to come from different industries and backgrounds. People are identifying this as a systematic problem with work, Weeks said. Whats interesting is the way people are making connections between their individual experiences and identifying patterns: Actually, theres something systemic here. There is a deeper problem thats producing these similar experiences. Lynn said reading the subreddit made her feel validated about quitting her job abruptly. She posted her story on the page and received dozens of comments of support. One person messaged her and said that her post inspired them to quit their job. My mindset has totally shifted on how I allowed myself to be treated, said Lynn, who has since started a new role at a different company that is giving her higher pay and better benefits. I definitely value my own personal time and family a lot more now that I recognize the value that a corporate entity actually sees in you.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/jun\/01\/natwest-preparing-for-just-13-of-staff-to-work-in-office-full-time","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/jun\/01\/natwest-preparing-for-just-13-of-staff-to-work-in-office-full-time","DATE":"2021-06-01 17:11:04","PLAIN_TEXT":"NatWest Group is preparing for a future where just 13% of staff work from the office full-time, as it becomes the latest major business to plan new remote working rules beyond the pandemic. About 8,300 staff will be expected to commute to the lenders offices and branches daily, leaving the rest of its 64,000 employees to split their time between home and office, even after the governments work-at-home orders are lifted. One in three of the banks staff - more than 20,000 workers - will be able to live and work anywhere in the UK and have to attend their office in person only two days a month. There is no one size fits all, as not every role is the same, the NatWest chief executive, Alison Rose, told staff last week. Some roles, and some people, will need to be back in the office 100% of the time - thats just the nature of the role; they cannot be done from home, Rose said. This group includes datacentre workers, traders and some branch staff. Other people will be able to work remotely the majority of the time, and for others there will be a hybrid solution. In a third pattern of working, which will be the most common, 55% of staff will adopt a hybrid of home and office working. This option will be offered to many of the banks customer-facing staff, who are increasingly dealing with clients via videolink. The plan means 32% - or roughly 20,400 staff - will be remote first. These workers can live anywhere in the country but must spend a minimum of two days in the office a month. The three-tier plan was first reported by Reuters. The move is not part of immediate office closure plans, according to a NatWest spokesperson. However, they confirmed that the lenders property footprint is always under review. The corporate world has become increasingly split over home working. While companies such as NatWest are embracing changing habits, others including Goldman Sachs have called remote working an aberration and expect staff to return to offices as soon as government guidance allows. HSBC and JP Morgan both said in April that thousands of staff would work from home permanently, while the accountancy firm EY told its 17,000 workers that they will be expected to work from home for at least two days a week even after restrictions are lifted. In March, PwC said it would let workers stay at home for half the time, while KPMG expects employees to only work two days a week in the office.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/mar\/31\/almost-half-of-working-age-women-in-uk-do-45-hours-of-unpaid-care-a-week-study","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/mar\/31\/almost-half-of-working-age-women-in-uk-do-45-hours-of-unpaid-care-a-week-study","DATE":"2022-03-31 10:10:21","PLAIN_TEXT":"Nearly half of working-age women are providing an average of 45 hours of unpaid care every week, while 25% of men provide 17 hours, according to a study highlighting the gulf in unpaid care work. Every year women in the UK are providing 23.2bn hours of unpaid childcare care worth an estimated PS382bn, while men provide 9.7bn worth PS160bn, according to research from the thinktank Centre for Progressive Policy. Calling unpaid work one of the driving forces of gender-based inequalities in the workplace, the CPP found that caring responsibilities disproportionately impact women and exacerbate workplace inequality. The thinktank recommends increasing the amount of free childcare for three- to four-year-olds from 570 hours a year to 720 hours and expanding to the 15 hours a week allowance for disadvantaged two-year-olds to cover 48 weeks and funding for after-school and holiday clubs. It also calls for a national target of 70% of job adverts highlighting flexibility by 2025 and a reform of parental leave that offers take-it-or-lose it paid leave for fathers and co-parents. Campaigners have long argued that current shared parental leave (SPL) policy is a deeply flawed and chronically failing policy and should be replaced. A survey carried out for the What Women Want research found that women do most unpaid care work for adults, with one in five women reducing their hours and 830,000 unable to work entirely because they cared for an adult. A quarter of women had reduced their hours at work to care for a child, while childcare prevented one in five women working more hours despite wanting to, the Yonder survey of 2,002 people found. One in five women caring for an adult had also reduced their paid hours. Interactive Interactive Calling for flexible work to be made a day-one right for workers, the CPP said 45% of women said they could work more with more flexibility. Increased flexible working could increase the earnings of female carers by PS28.4bn a year, and add PS60bn a year to the UK economy. Access to childcare needed to improve, working practices changed and unpaid work shared more equally if women were going to get an equal shot at work, said Dean Hochlaf, social policy expert at CPP. The economic gains for women and wider society could be immense giving women greater control and choice in their working lives, and generating significant economic gains that benefit everyone, he said. It comes as the Coram Family and Childcares 21st annual childcare survey revealed that the cost of childcare for children under two has risen by 2.5% in the past year, while only 57% of local authorities report having sufficient childcare places for children under two. A survey by Pregnant Then Screwed and Mumsnet last week found that two-thirds of respondents were paying as much or more for their childcare than for their rent or mortgage. The Labour MP Stella Creasy, said women were being squeezed from the workforce. This is destabilising our future financial security and draining talent from the economy, she said. We need the government to act and make balancing work and family life a reality for everyone, not just those who can afford it. A government spokesperson said: We have invested more than PS3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver the governments free childcare offers, including the 30 hours per week for working parents. We are also investing millions in Family Hubs - where families can access important support services. We continue to look for ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare, and to further support working families we have brought forward flexible parental leave arrangements, including up to 52 weeks of maternity leave - one of the most generous entitlements in the world.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/jul\/04\/revealed-rise-in-stress-among-those-working-from-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/jul\/04\/revealed-rise-in-stress-among-those-working-from-home","DATE":"2021-07-04 05:45:13","PLAIN_TEXT":"Working from home during the coronavirus pandemic has caused increased levels of loneliness and mental distress, according to new research into how workers have been affected by the crisis. With ministers still debating how to manage the return to workplaces in the wake of Covid restrictions, a study by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) found that the biggest increases in mental distress and loneliness during the pandemic were felt by the most isolated group - those working from home and living alone. However, in a finding that surprised researchers, people working from home and living with others also experienced a significant increase in loneliness not felt by those working outside the home. Analysts examined data from interviews carried out with 8,675 people before the pandemic and in May, July and November 2020. They found that people able to work from home have been protected from financial difficulties that can drive poor mental health. When financial circumstances, loneliness and demographic characteristics were controlled for in the research, however, people working from home recorded bigger increases in mental distress. More of us than ever now work from home and use technology to replace many aspects of work previously done in person, but this cannot fully replicate the working environment for everyone, said Isabel Taylor, research director at NatCen. As the government considers current working guidance, individuals, employers and government departments should be aware of the impact working from home is likely having on peoples mental health. People were first advised to work from home by the government in March last year. A month later almost half of UK workers were working from home at least some of the time. While limited numbers of people have returned to their workplaces since, advice to work from home has continued into 2021. The advice could end on 19 July, though a debate about the measure remains. Experts from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have warned in official papers that some measures are likely to be needed beyond the end of the current road map process to avoid the likelihood of having to reverse parts of the road map. Government sources have denied reports that it was drawing up plans to give workers the right to work from home for ever if they wished to do so. However, they are planning a shift towards greater flexibility for workers in the future. Even before the pandemic hit, the 2019 Conservative election manifesto vowed to encourage flexible working and consult on making it the default unless employers have good reasons not to. It would require legal changes and legislation that has not yet been published. Meanwhile, unions have warned of an opening divide between those in higher-paid professions who can work from home and those in lower-paid, more insecure work that have had to be more rigid about bringing employees back to the workplace. The new NatCen paper states that there are other considerations that should be taken into account, including the interactions between colleagues and the clearer divide between work and personal lives that could be playing a part in its findings about mental health distress. The lack of new experiences and face-to-face interactions during the pandemic may be contributing to increased mental distress for home workers who would not class themselves as lonely, it found.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"theobserver\/commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/04\/letters-building-muscle-is-not-just-for-superstars","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/theobserver\/commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/04\/letters-building-muscle-is-not-just-for-superstars","DATE":"2022-09-04 05:00:39","PLAIN_TEXT":"In Yvonne Robertss criticism of Nicole Kidman for keeping fit and being proud of it, she mentions that exercise can be enjoyable (Fab abs, Nicole.

I am a year older than Kidman and I swim three times a week, go to Pilates, cycle into town, walk the dog and eat pretty healthily. I still dont look like Kidman and I cant act, but I love the activity, feeling fit and strong and the mental benefits that come with it. It is not trying to turn the clock back but living my life in good shape, enjoying my body and respecting it. With luck, it will also reduce some of the health issues of old age, but if not Ill still have had a good time.Debo AdamsSudbury, Suffolk Nicole Kidmans body is abnormal and has been acquired only because she has money, power, stylists and a lot of time. Any magazine cover heralding this as perfect is lying to the public and its readership. Im in my 50s and I wouldnt mind looking like I did 20 (or even 10) years ago. But how can I look my daughters - who I remind constantly to love themselves as they are and not to conform to imprisoning stereotypes - in the face if I resort to surgery, surgery and more surgery? Kidman is a great actor and highly intelligent. This magazine cover though; its a parallel universe. Women age. Deal with it.Donna WhiteBarnet, London Im in a Facebook group with around 60 women in their 50s from all over the world, only two of whom Ive ever met. We post about our self-defined fitness sessions: a long dog walk, a Pilates class, a CrossFit session. Each of us is aiming to get to 222 sessions by year end. Last year it was 221 and the year before 220; you get the picture. Its sisterly and supportive, non-judgmental, celebratory. Lots of us do weights and resistance exercise; none of us looks like Nicole Kidman. But there is muscle definition, there are abs, quads and biceps and most of all there are glowy, smiley, red-faced selfies. Im pretty unlikely to be in the group in 2050 with a 250 session target, but if I am it will probably have something to do with the proven benefits of weightbearing exercise for older women. This isnt frantic self-improvement but sensible future-proofing; a cheap set of dumbbells and a consistent 3 x 30-minute sessions a week at home. It stabilises our joints, helps resist the impacts of decreasing bone density and means we can keep putting one foot in front of the other for longer.

(Is it time to ditch the term gardening?, Magazine). Id suggest its because so few young people are homeowners and so many are renting. When renting, you can be booted out of your home for no reason with a Section 21 notice, so why bother cultivating the back garden and spending hundreds on bulbs, shrubs and little trees when you could lose it all at the thwack of a letter on the doormat? Why invest in trowels, gardening gloves, bags of compost or woodchip and endless weekend afternoons of your time on something so precarious? Worse, landlords may have their own ideas about what may be done with their gardens. When I was renting, I recall tidying up the garden and planting a few cheap berry bushes. The following weekend, he rolled up with some workmen and dumped a load of building materials over them. I pretty much gave up after that. Please remember that gardening, decorating, home improvements or DIY are mostly off limits to Generation Rent and will be until we have long-overdue reform of the rental sector.Gavin HolmesNorwich Refugees and red tape Kenan Malik is right (There are lies, damn lies and then there is Home Office propaganda, Comment). The Home Office is full of contradictory and impossible advice. Afghans facing serious risk in Afghanistan are advised that they need to apply for a visa to come to the UK [but] there is no Visa Application Centre (VAC) operating in Afghanistan. What to do? You will normally have to submit your biometric information (fingerprints and photograph) in a VAC in a third country to complete your application. So you must scramble with your children to a neighbouring country and then find a VAC. If you lose heart, of course, and decide to make your own way here, you will end up in Rwanda.Bob MouncerHull Factory farming harms water While the reduction in the number of farm inspections certainly needs to be reversed (Farmers free to pollute our rivers because Truss slashed red tape, News), the fundamental reason why agriculture is now the number one cause of water pollution is that todays industrial-scale intensive farms keep huge numbers of animals on areas of land that are far too small to absorb the animals waste products. An end to factory farming and the reduction in the number of animals farmed would help with water pollution, climate change (partly caused by methane emissions from cattle) and the worrying growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (partly caused by the misuse of antibiotics on factory farms). It would also reduce the scale of the misery, frustration and sometimes chronic pain experienced by millions of farmed animals today.Iain Green, director, Animal Aid, Tonbridge, Kent Forget Mars.

Our appreciation of the fragility of our unique planet would be enhanced much more by watching programmes such as David Attenboroughs or Climate Change: Ade on the Frontline.

Our commitment to provide an inclusive environment has been recognised by Stonewall with a silver award and weve been ranked as one of the countrys leading employers for LGBTQ+ staff. Our involvement in the Stonewall scheme is contingent on the results it brings in improving diversity and inclusion in our workplace, not the threat of public controversy. Stonewall does not have power of influence over our policy stance. This is established through a member-led process, entirely separate from our employment function. The polarised debate on trans rights might have often prevented balanced discussion but it has not stopped the College from advocating for trans and gender diverse peoples right to mental healthcare. The publication of our position statement from 2018 is a prime example of the integrity of our policy work, making it abundantly clear that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder and should have never been classified as one. At the same time, we make the case for continuing to support psychiatrists in their role to fully explore their patients gender identity, in a non-judgmental, supportive and ethical manner. To deliver on this, we need to build the evidence base that will enable young people, their families, carers and the clinicians supporting them to make more informed decisions about the right care for them. The interim Cass review recommendations echo our own calls for more research and the need for a cautious but compassionate approach to the care of children and young people, in the meantime. We will be offering our full support to the review to make sure that the final recommendations can help services learn from past mistakes and that children and young people with gender dysphoria can access good mental healthcare, when they need to.

As some see it, if the purchase goes through, that should worry us. Its all about the data, says David Vaile from the Australian Privacy Foundation. Privacy advocates such as Vaile are concerned the robot vacuum cleaner will give Amazon access to floor plans of users homes, using mapping features some iRobot products already offer. Amazon are yet to release details about what existing and future iRobot data will be used for; and the company told Reuters that they safeguard customer privacy and do not sell their data. But Vaile says of big tech companies: Theyre about collecting data, and the products and services are really just bait to lure and hopefully lock in unsuspecting data subjects. Their opportunities for manipulating you and exploiting you, once theyve spied on you, are more or less open-ended and getting broader all the time. Related: The smart toilet era is here! Are you ready to share your analprint with big tech? At its gentlest, data gathered by smart devices can be used by manufacturers to figure out how to more effectively sell you products. At worst, it can mean staff listening to conversations recorded by your smart speakers or sharing your doorbell camera videos with the police. And as with anything internet-connected, there is also a risk of hackers gaining access to your private information. But despite the risks, smart home technology is booming. Even if youre not inclined to purchase an internet-connected fish tank or a toilet that tracks and analyses your stool samples, odds are youve got at least one smart device at home. It could be the TV you stream Netflix on, your baby monitor or the air conditioner you control with an app. So is it possible to have a smart home and not be spied on? Well, sort of. The big decisions From a data privacy perspective, the smartest home is a dumb home. Thats the real answer: dont do it, Vaile says. Failing that, he recommends paring back your system as much as possible. Just ask all the time: why do I need this? he says. Because every one of the fancy new tricks will come with both a privacy and a data security cost. The simpler the system, the better off youll be. Simplifying means disabling certain features on existing devices and being judicious about what you buy. Andre Lackmann, an IT professional from Sydney, has many smart devices at home - but not security cameras. This limits his privacy and security risk to a level he is comfortable with. To do this yourself, he suggests imagining the consequences of a data breach. If they get some information about when my lights went on and off, or what temperature it is in the living room, thats not a big deal, Lackmann says. But if they can get a video feed of the bedroom, thats a bit of a problem, right? Its also a matter of determining what data youre willing to trade in return for greater convenience. For instance, Lackmann has Phillips Hue smart lights - but has disabled the feature that allows him to control them remotely. That function requires an internet connection, and switching the lights off when hes out feels like a small reward for letting a company into his home. As soon as you connect the internet, from a data privacy point of view, you are in the hands of the manufacturers Matt Furnell Lackmann does, however, allow his air conditioner remote access, because for him, being able to set the temperature before he comes home is useful enough to make his data sacrifice worthwhile. When youre at the decision-making stage, you might also like to consult the Mozilla privacy not included guide before you buy, to get an idea of just how creepy different products are. You will also need to balance your risk of being hacked with data privacy concerns. If there is a security risk, bigger companies such as Google and Amazon will roll out updates that fix the problem quickly. A security camera fished from the bargain bin may not, Lackmann says. [With] smaller, no-name brands, its not that the devices are bad, per se. It is generally that they dont get a lot of after-sale support, he says. [Smaller brands] are much less likely to get any security updates. To that end, it is also important to regularly install the updates for your products once theyre in your home. The set-up For Matt Furnell and Justin Kern from JFK Automation, a company that installs smart home systems, the key to data privacy is avoiding cloud-based services and internet-connected devices as much as possible. As soon as you connect the internet, from a data privacy point of view, you are in the hands of the manufacturers, says Furnell. So you should give them the least amount possible to work with. If you are trying to stay off the cloud, youll need to skip the assistant function on speakers. Photograph: Oscar WongGetty Images In many products, the pair say, cloud connectivity is unavoidable, but others will allow for workarounds - for instance, sending security camera footage to a hard drive in your house. If you are trying to stay off the cloud, youll need to skip the assistant function on speakers. Whether youre asking Alexa, Siri or Google, Kern and Furnell say that every voice command product currently available in Australia connects to the cloud. For customers who are particularly privacy-conscious, JFK Automation doesnt connect the system to the internet at all. That means customers sacrifice the ability to control their devices remotely and instead operate everything using an offline app. Related: Amazons Ring is the largest civilian surveillance network the US has ever seen | Lauren Bridges Putting your smart home devices on a separate internet network to your computers and phones can help with security, but not data privacy. This is what Lackmann does. I have one network that has all of the home automation gear on it and another network that has all of my personal information - our laptops, computer storage, files and stuff like that, he says. That way if his smart devices are compromised, theyre segregated from the more important information. Simpler fixes Already got smart devices at home? You can still minimise what companies collect and what hackers can get. To understand just how many of your home gadgets rely on the internet, Furnell and Kern recommend switching off your router to see what stops working. From there, you might decide to kick devices off your wifi if you dont feel they need to be online. You can also turn off any voice-assistant functionalities and cover up cameras you dont need - for instance, sticking paper over your baby monitors when theyre not in use. Something as simple as putting tape on cameras when theyre not in use can help with smart home privacy. Photograph: Dima BerlinGetty ImagesiStockphoto Be particularly mindful of home assistant products with screens. People dont necessarily think that the cameras are doing anything, Kern says. But they probably are watching what youre doing. Some devices may allow you to opt out of sharing analytics back to the manufacturers during the set-up process. However, Furnell says, theyll still be storing your data - which you should be able to log on and delete. Once every three months or so, Furnell will log into his devices to see what they have collected and what they are doing with the data, then he deletes the stored data. However, Vaile cautions that playing around with your privacy preferences gives a misleading feeling of ... control. The metadata analysis - the data collection thats unaffected by preferences - is probably much more important to them, and much more significant to you. Ultimately, if you want a smart home, you will have to accept that convenience comes with a privacy trade-off. You cant have your cake and eat it too, says Kern. If you want to have all these functions and features ... you have to be connected to the internet, and there is a risk of someone having your data.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/oct\/15\/brother-do-you-love-me-rescue-manni-reuben-coe-book-downs-syndrome","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/oct\/15\/brother-do-you-love-me-rescue-manni-reuben-coe-book-downs-syndrome","DATE":"2022-10-15 15:00:10","PLAIN_TEXT":"They were just five words, separated by four tiny full stops and four spaces: brother. do. you. love. me. But when, in November 2020, that text from Reuben Coe, who was alone in his room in a care home in Dorset, arrived on the phone of his brother Manni in Andalusia there was little else he could do. Manni had to get him out. Soon the 48-year-old travel guide was packing his bags, saying an indeterminate goodbye to his partner Jack and flying to Britain on a one-way ticket. He collected Reuben, 38, who has Downs syndrome, from the home, where he was given a 10% chance of recovering from the terrible toll isolation had taken on him, and took him to a cottage in a village near the Jurassic Coast. For the next 26 weeks he had one goal in mind - trying to help his brother, who at the time was non-verbal, locked in and depressed, get better. But what materialised was a journey that is still unfolding. The brothers have published a book, featuring Mannis writing and Reubens drawings, they are going on tour around the UK, and Reuben - who Manni believes is now at around 75% of his former self and getting better daily - has a new home. Sitting in an emerald green chair in the middle of a theatre in south-west London, Reuben is quick to communicate. Showing me a newspaper picture of the Queen lying in state, he softly says: I miss her. Manni, left, and Reuben Coe. Photograph: Andy HallThe Observer On the floor next to him is a blue tote bag, to which he later carefully returns the newspaper, and on his person at all times is a narrow paintbrush, which he sometimes uses to stroke his skin or the chair. He often looks up at the dramatically lit stage, dressed in forest scenery, which instantly reminds him of Jack and the Beanstalk. Before I arrived, they were dancing around the auditorium to Beauty and the Beast, says Manni. Later in the evening, Reuben, who loves theatre, films and musicals, will appear on the stage of the Normansfield Theatre at the Langdon Down Centre in Teddington in front of a room full of people to huge applause. The book, published this month by Little Toller Books, tells the story of their journey together during Covid and how they wrote and drew their way through one of their biggest ever challenges. Their pictures and words communicate with one another but also express the voices of two interweaving individual lives. It also describes their lives growing up in the Yorkshire Dales, then Berkshire, with their parents in a family of four brothers - a life that orbited the church, writes Manni. At one point they lived in the care home that their father ran. Originally, there was no plan to share their writings and drawings publicly, says Manni. Reubens boldly coloured felt-tipped drawings - which include Josephs technicoloured dreamcoat, many lions and the lamppost from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - were a means of expression and communication at a time when words were not available. Every night he would do a drawing for me, give me a kiss, whisper night brother, and then hand it to me upside down, so there was a big reveal, says Manni. And thats how we communicated - he communicated with me through drawing. And for Manni, who has always written, it was a form of therapy. Writing about it gave me hope because I realised that there was a narrative and I wanted it to be a happy ending, he says, his voice cracking with emotion. So if I was writing it, it was giving me inspiration that we could push this through to a happy ending. Every night he would do a drawing, give me a kiss, whisper night brother, and then hand it to me. And thats how we communicated Manni Coe Their six-week tour, which will take them around bookshops and festivals around England and Wales, will culminate at Hay festival with Sally Phillips interviewing them, after Manni approached the actor in a chance encounter at a restaurant. The first thing Reuben plans to say to her is her Miranda catchphrase bear with. How does it feel to be sharing such an intensely personal journey? Were still getting used to it, because weve lived a very quiet last year, says Manni. It does feel as if were taking it outside. So it was a very private thing and now it becomes very public. Reuben is clear about why theyre doing it. Help people, he says. Manni adds: We think we can. We think that what weve lived through will help other people. They have already had people who have read the book get in touch. Its a story that so many connect with, says Manni. Not just people who have someone in the family with Downs syndrome or a sibling, but anybody who was isolated in lockdown - and we were many. Covid hasnt gone away. Some people are still living it. Before September 2018, when Reuben lived with his brother and his partner in Spain , he was chatty Cathy, says Manni. Always the life and soul of the party. He didnt use many full sentences but he was a skilled communicator. He clinically regressed, then improved, before regressing massively when he was admitted to a care home in February 2020. Family Zooms made everybody feel further away, not closer. A picture taken during lockdown of Reuben shows him gazing from his bedroom window, one hand against the glass. One of Reuben Coes drawings, based on The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which feature in his new book. Photograph: Manni Coe Manni spent nearly two months visiting him every day over the summer but returned to Spain with huge doubts. It was only a November selfie, of Reuben roaring like a lion, that gave him any hope. It was a defining moment. Thats when I saw that he was ready to fight and that hed found courage. Soon after that came the text - brother. do. you. love. me. - which would inspire the title of their book. The text was not a question, says Manni, it was a prompt. That was Reubens way of saying come and get me out of here. If you love me then show me the colour of your love. Is that what you meant Reubs? Reuben raises his finger in agreement. The colour of their love is probably a red rainbow, he says. But when Manni went to collect him from the care home, Reuben was not in a good way. When I got him out of the home he was totally nonverbal. And thats how the drawing happened. He was communicating by drawing. They started going for walks, gradually increasing the distance, and Reuben saw a therapist, who joined their Covid bubble. She came to the house once a week and started helping Reuben on the physical recovery as well, because he had muscle wastage and was really weak as he hadnt gone anywhere for months, says Manni. And she started working on his expression. On Fridays they would put on musicals and stage them live on Instagram. And one day Manni decided to pretend it was Christmas, complete with a tree and decorations. The therapist came with music from his favourite films - Lord of the Rings, Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang - and started doing dances with her fingers which Reuben would shadow.Another central element of life that Reuben had been missing was touch. No one really touched him for months, and thats where the paintbrush came from, for sensation. Its quite heartbreaking, says Manni. Describing their first hug when they were reunited, Manni says it was just amazing. He says that Reuben told him afterwards: I needed that - to which Reuben raises his finger to show me he is in agreement. This is not the first time Manni has had to take Reuben out of care. The first was a few years ago when he was sent for a visit to Spain dressed in his pyjamas. We called it Dirty Sheets, he says. And Reubs was obese, massively overweight. You werent in a good place, were you Reubs? Their experiences have shown Manni that care homes are only as good as the people working in them. The two negative experiences we had, it was all down to staffing problems, lack of staff, not enough people for too many tenants, he says. Of the first home he had to take Reuben out of, he adds: They were looking after him but they werent caring for him. Theres a big difference, I think. Reuben Coes Aslan drawing from brother.do.you.love.me Photograph: Reuben Coe Caring, he believes, should be a well-paid career. Its a special gift, and so many people who are gifted carers have to move on simply because they cant make it work financially. When Reuben was ready for a more independent life, Manni and Jack strongly considered inviting him to live with them again, but felt the best option was for him to be somewhere he could create his own community. In a list of good things Reuben compiled before moving in, he wrote: Am home now They found him a place at a newly built home in Dorset, where there are no communal areas or corridors but individual private spaces that residents can invite each other into. Reuben has his own tenancy agreement, and is encouraged to be as independent as possible. After a period of transition, Manni returned to his life in Spain. Saying goodbye after their time in the cottage together was desperately painful. But now Reuben says he feels at home there. In a list of good things he compiled before moving in, he wrote: Am home now. Manni is working on his next book, a prequel to this one, about when they bought the home in Spain.

Women who want children are not having them. Why? Surveys tell us that, on average, women and men in rich countries would ideally like two children - near the coveted population replacement rate of 2.1 - but birthrates are falling far short of this. Women have more money and choices than ever, but are for some reason not able to have as many children as they would like. Why not? Well, in places such as the UK, falling birthrates are frequently blamed on childcare, housing and income problems. In some respects, people in their 20s, 30s and 40s are worse off than their boomer parents. Hence fewer children. That feels right. But compare the situation of todays young to almost any group other than their boomer parents and our theory falls apart. Millennials in the modern rich world live in far greater luxury than their child-popping contemporaries in poorer countries. Even within millennial groups in the US and Europe, it is among the middle and upper classes where birthrates are mostly falling. This is not just about money. Since the 90s, parental incentives have soared across rich countries, yet birthrates have continued to plummet. Last weeks plea from a Chinese health official for leaders to make bold innovations to boost the birthrate, after financial incentives failed to work, fit a global pattern. OK: so its about social structures, then? Lack of childcare, unequal parental leave and career penalties for mothers. Not so - or not primarily. In our fecund recent past, remember, career penalties for mothers were even higher. Mothers still suffer a career penalty almost everywhere, but attempting to remove it doesnt seem to alter their decisions that much. Since 2008, amid unequalled progress in gender equality and some of the most generous parental support schemes on the planet, birthrates in Sweden, Norway and Iceland have fallen precipitously. Nordic countries are, comparatively, parental utopias, yet birthrates tick along slightly above the EU average and still well below the replacement rate. Since 2008, birthrates in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland have fallen precipitously: a street in Stockholm. Photograph: Fredrik SandbergTTEPA Better childcare and parental provision are, of course, worthwhile policies on their own terms: they increase human happiness but they do not change birthrates all that much. In fact, falling birthrates track with just one metric: a rise in female empowerment itself. The right to contraception and abortion allows women not to have children they dont want and life offers them a greater range of interesting choices outside motherhood. That accounts for a lot but it doesnt explain why women with all these increased choices are having fewer children than they would like. No one has nailed down the answer. What is that? Well, here is a suggestion. Surveys of childless women tell us that a top reason is not career, lifestyle or financially related: its that they just havent found the right partner. This was the second most common reason given in a representative UK study of 42-year-old childless women - right behind not wanting children. (Focusing on career was way down the list.) US studies echo this. Fertility rates within marriages have stayed fairly steady since the 1990s. Gay couples have started to add to birthrates too but the dramatic rise in childless women - and their inability to find the right partner - is driving a good deal of the rich worlds birthrate fall. Hang on, why is it that only modern women have this problem? How is this related to empowerment? Well, just not being able to find the right man is a fairly recent luxury for women. Their grandmothers and great-grandmothers who didnt find the right man would probably at some point simply have had to pair up with the wrong man - single life, or spinsterhood, was just too miserable and poverty-stricken. Women spending this Valentines Day alone should consider that in ages past they would probably have been married by now, happily or not. Women may not in theory want to be single and childless, but they can afford to be if the right person doesnt come along. That is how increased choice might paradoxically result in women who want children not having them. If correct, our theory would present policymakers with a conundrum. Falling birthrates are a problem for countries that fret about shrinking workforces. But they are also being driven by something positive: greater female choice. We cannot simply suggest single women - or indeed single men, who are making many of these choices - alter their expectations when they have freely decided that they would rather pay the price for not doing so. Immigration is only a sticking plaster for rich countries: birthrates will soon fall everywhere. But theres another more radical solution to all this. Single women may not want to pair up, but they can still have children alone. Yet single motherhood is still offputtingly tough and to some extent socially penalised. In China, single mothers have only just got the same rights as married ones. Policymakers would do well to think about how they could better support single mothers. Target them and watch birthrates rise. * Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The officials said companies who hired and paid such workers may be exposing themselves to legal consequences for sanctions violations. There are thousands of DPRK IT workers both dispatched overseas and located within the DPRK, generating revenue that is remitted back to the North Korean government. These IT workers take advantage of existing demands for specific IT skills, such as software and mobile application development, to obtain freelance employment contracts from clients around the world, including in North America, Europe, and east Asia.

The advisory says that while much of the surreptitious job-seeking is to earn foreign exchange or to access virtual currency exchanges, some of the workers have helped Pyongyangs government-backed hacking operations.

The accounting firm said it would let staff decide when, where and how they work following the success of remote working during the Covid crisis. While the company has offered more flexible working since 2014, the latest announcement will mean ditching its office-focused approach once the final phase of lockdown restrictions are lifted next month. We will let our people choose where they need to be to do their best work, in balance with their professional and personal responsibilities, the Deloitte chief executive, Richard Houston, said. Im not going to announce any set number of days for people to be in the office or in specific locations. That means that our people can choose how often they come to the office, if they choose to do so at all, while focusing on how we can best serve our clients. That compares with some rivals such as PwC, which expects staff to spend at least 40% of their time with colleagues - either in the office or out on client visit - once Covid rules allow. However, the government is expected to take a neutral stance on the issue once the rest of lockdown restrictions are lifted in England on 19 July. Sources have told the Guardian that workers will not be told to return to offices and that companies will be left to make their own decisions. It marks a U-turn from last summer, when Boris Johnson was accused of rushing employees back to struggling city centres in an effort to revive the economy, despite the continued risks. Related: The empty office: what we lose when we work from home But the governments hands-off approach could cause confusion for workers and allow employers to dictate terms, according to Labour, which has called for stronger rights for staff so that workers are not pressured or blackmailed back into unsafe workplaces. Labours approach could mean staff at major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would have the right to push back on hardline return-to-office plans. The Goldman Sachs boss, David Solomon, has famously called remote working an aberration and claimed he was worried about how to train the next generation of bankers if most staff were operating remotely. Morgan Stanleys chief executive, James Gorman, has suggested workers cannot expect the same high wages if they avoid city centres. If you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York.

Deloittes decision will mean reserving most of its office space for team collaboration, training and client meetings, though each team would have to ensure their arrangement suited clients and staff, the company said. A recent staff survey found that 81% of Deloittes employees expected to work from home up to two days a week in the future, while 96% wanted the freedom to choose how flexibly they work in future. This is a fantastic opportunity for us to embrace the benefits from the last 16 months of being able to spend more time at home, said Houston, while our people can be flexible in the way they work and reconnect with their colleagues and the office as needed.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2021\/jun\/17\/home-quarantine-in-uk-for-travellers-not-working-experts-warn-covid","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/jun\/17\/home-quarantine-in-uk-for-travellers-not-working-experts-warn-covid","DATE":"2021-06-17 17:03:36","PLAIN_TEXT":"Home quarantine for travellers doesnt work while long Covid has not featured in government decisions around how to tackle the pandemic in the UK, experts have said. Cases of the Delta variant are rising rapidly in the UK, with 11,007 new infections reported on Thursday - the highest figure since 19 February. The variant now accounts for more than 90% of new Covid cases while early data has suggested it is somewhat more resistant to Covid jabs than the Alpha variant, particularly after one dose, and might be linked to a greater risk of being admitted to hospital with Covid. Speaking at a Royal Society of Medicine webinar, Prof Graham Medley, chair of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), which advises the government, suggested limiting travel from India to the UK earlier than 23 April would likely have delayed but not prevented the Delta variant becoming established in the UK. Prof Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, agreed. I think the lessons are that if you take the policy of Australia and New Zealand [which have very tight border controls], then it can be effective, but anything much less than that is at best slowing things down, he said. One of the things this last experience with Delta in the UK has highlighted is that home quarantine for travellers just doesnt work. I mean, everybody coming in from India in April of this year was meant to quarantine at home [for 10 days], but it has still established itself. default Ferguson went on to suggest the border controls were more about appearances than impact. I think we need to think carefully about the extent to which travel restrictions are really intended to be effective, in which case they have to be quite stringent. Or we adopt a different strategy, he said. While concerns have been growing about long Covid, with recent figures suggesting more than 376,000 people in the UK have been living with symptoms for more than a year, Medley revealed it had not featured in expert modelling. Thats mainly because the governments focus is on the healthcare burden in terms of tertiary healthcare [hospitals], he said, adding that this needs careful thought as the burden of Covid is now being shared more between primary care and hospitals. I think long Covid is a significant issue. But at the moment it hasnt really played into government decisions, he said. Ferguson said the Delta variant appeared to be about 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, and that a new wave of infections had already begun. The million dollar question is - we are going to see lots of cases in the next few weeks, I am sure of that - but how is that going to translate into hospitalisations and of course into deaths? There is greater uncertainty around the answer to that, he said. The comments came as Englands chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, also warned of a rise in case rates in the next few weeks because of the Delta variant being significantly more transmissible than the Alpha variant. Speaking to an NHS conference, he added: In terms of the medium term, my expectation is that we will get a further winter surge, late autumnwinter surge, and that is because we know that winter and autumn favour respiratory viruses, he said. However Ferguson noted there were some encouraging signals including that Covid vaccines offer around 90% protection against hospitalisation with the Delta variant. Ferguson also said Covid patients may be spending less time in hospital once admitted, meaning hospitals may be able to cope with a higher level of admissions. However, speaking to the Commons science and technology committee on Wednesday, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for NHS test and trace, and deputy director of Public Health Englands National Infection Service, said the reduction was only small, not least because certain treatments such as remdesivir required a hospital stay of a number of days. We are seeing a younger population coming into hospital and we are seeing the median length of stay is slightly less, not significantly less, but more time is required for us to give fuller figures on that, she said. Ferguson added the relaxation of restrictions in Britain last month probably contributed to the rise in infections - a situation further relaxations would amplify - but both he and Medley said they thought it was unlikely such restrictions would be reapplied. Meanwhile, Londoners will be able to get vaccinated this weekend at a series of super pop-up clinics which the NHS is setting up at sports venues such as the football stadiums where Chelsea, West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur play, on a pre-booked or walk-in basis. The clinics will be open to people of all ages but are aimed at young adults in particular and are part of an NHS drive to get two-thirds of adults in England double-vaccinated before 19 July, the new, delayed date by which Boris Johnson hopes to ease most of the remaining restrictions on social mixing. London has seen some of Englands lowest take-up rates of Covid vaccines.

An Observer investigation has uncovered evidence of pressure-selling tactics by some agencies in England, including cases where people were told they were required to sign up as a condition of securing a tenancy. Touted as a low-cost option, zero deposit schemes typically involve payment of a fee equivalent to about a weeks rent instead of a standard security deposit, which is normally five weeks rent. But unlike a traditional deposit, the fee is non-refundable, with tenants remaining liable for damages at the end of their tenancy. They can also face extra costs for membership renewals and - unlike with standard deposits - face fees for adjudication in the event of a dispute, leaving them worse off in the long run. Despite the concerns, renters are routinely being advised to sign up for the schemes by letting agents, who stand to earn commission of up to 30% for each person they refer. The pressure-selling allegations and concerns about the level of protection the schemes offer have led to warnings of a PPI-style mis-selling scandal from senior industry figures, with one expert accusing letting agents of preying on tenants by pushing the schemes. The Observer spoke to six tenants who had rented properties in different parts of the country, through different agencies, but all say they were not given the choice or were pressured by agents into signing up to zero deposit schemes. Travis and his partner Hannah, from Bath, said they were forced to enrol in a zero deposit scheme after applying to rent a house in Cornwall, which involved payment of a PS225 non-refundable joining fee. They asked instead to pay a standard deposit - which would be protected in an authorised scheme and is usually fully refundable aside from damages - but were told that was not an option. If that is something that will be a deal-breaker for you, the landlord would more than likely look to the next applicant who would be willing to go down the zero deposit route, the letting agent said in an email. They had already been searching for months so accepted the terms. It felt unethical and unfair. We were pushed into a corner, Travis, 33, a hospitality manager, said. We thought there must be some kind of kickback but they didnt mention it. Letting agencies are earning thousands of pounds in commission by encouraging tenants to use zero deposit schemes. Photograph: William BartonAlamy Others were told the zero deposit scheme was the landlords preferred option at the application stage, indicating that tenants agreeing to it would be given priority. With soaring rents and fierce competition for properties, they felt they had no choice but to accept. Renters were sometimes later asked to tick a box confirming that they had been given a choice, and could not move forward with the tenancy until they had done so. May, 24, a PhD student renting in London, said that she felt coerced into signing up for a zero deposit scheme despite having enough cash for a full deposit. She had been told by email that it was the landlords preferred option. The implication was that if we didnt say yes, the agency would choose someone else, she said. We had to pay PS170 each in non-refundable fees. But after weeks of looking for somewhere to live we didnt really feel in a position to negotiate. The schemes are a valid option that can be offered by letting agents, but requiring tenants to sign up to them is likely to be a breach of the ban on tenant fees, which was introduced in 2019 to tackle profiteering. Breaches carry fines of up to PS5,000. David Votta, president of the Association of Residential Lettings Agents, said that he was still on the fence about zero deposit products, which he said provided a benefit by offering a lower upfront payment but could result in tenants being aggressively pursued for costs. Its often not the agent trying to pursue them, itll be debt recovery, and they will want their money with top interest, fees and charges on top, he said. Agents introducing the schemes should give tenants a true choice about signing up, provide accurate information about how they work and declare any commission, he said. But while good agents abide by those standards, others do not. What we dont want is a PPI moment, he added. The concern would be that there would be people getting sued off the back of it. They could say, youve mis-sold this to the tenant: youve not provided them with sufficient data to make an informed decision, and you enforced this product on them to earn commission and hit your target. The findings have led to calls for a crackdown on agents who flout the rules, with National Trading Standards saying that it was examining concerns about the sale of zero deposit schemes, with a view to taking action. James Munro, head of the Estate and Letting Agency Team, which is responsible for enforcing the fees ban, said that requiring tenants to pick zero deposit options was bordering on discrimination and a likely breach of the ban on tenancy fees. Often its the agent who is the one in the middle really pushing these schemes, and a lot of the time its driven by referrals, he said. As well as concerns about mis-selling, the growth of the zero deposit industry has led to warnings from the charity Shelter, the campaign group Generation Rent and the renters union Acorn that more people could be tempted to enrol due to cost of living pressures. The terms of zero deposit schemes vary greatly by provider. Schemes range from regulated insurance products that cover any damages, to unregulated schemes that can leave renters liable for large sums at the end of their tenancy. Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said that while the schemes could seem to be a good option if youre struggling to pull cash together, renters could end up paying hundreds of pounds in fees with no option to get their money back at the end of their tenancy. Its so important you know what youre getting into, he said. Judy*, 27, a healthcare assistant from Northampton, picked a zero deposit option because of the lower upfront cost but paid more in the end. After her tenancy ended, in a dispute over a bill for alleged damages, the arbitration process was handled by the zero deposit scheme company, which had a contract with her landlord. It found in the landlords favour, and she is now repaying PS50 a month towards PS550 costs, in addition to the PS150 non-refundable fee she paid to join the scheme in the first place. It looked like a cheaper deal but in the end it didnt feel fair, she said. Zero deposit companies deny that their products offer fewer protections and have distanced themselves from the behaviour of third-party agencies that sell or introduce their products to tenants. One scheme provider, Flatfair, which charges a check-in fee of one weeks rent, and an adjudication fee of PS25 in disputes, said that it did not have control over the behaviour of agents, and that allegations of pressure-selling were concerning. We insist that our deposit alternative is offered as a choice as per existing regulations and provide regular training to support this, Flatfair said. It added that it offered a transparent resolution process to ensure all parties get a fair outcome, and did not believe agencies were motivated by the limited commissions they could earn. The company has previously paid up to 30% commission per referral but would not disclose its current rates, which it said were lower than that. There have been several cases of alleged pressure-selling linked to Flatfairs products. In a recent memo to staff, one lettings agency warned agents that they could not force tenants to enrol. Weve recently had two cases go through where the tenant felt forced to take out a Flatfair membership, the email, reported by trade publication The Negotiator, said. Sam Reynolds, chief executive at Zero Deposit, a major scheme that is a regulated insurance product, said that his team conducted regular mystery shops and that cases where agents pressured tenants into signing up were rare. The company is calling for a code of conduct that makes Financial Conduct Registration mandatory. Related: Facing eviction, Ive learned that relying on good landlords is a feudal throwback | Moya Lothian-McLean The property ombudsman, which considers complaints about agent behaviour, said that it was unable to consider complaints about the zero deposit schemes themselves but that letting agents were obliged to accurately explain how alternative deposit products work and must declare commissions. It said it was concerned about claims of pressure-selling and was working closely with the National Trading Standards Estate and Lettings Agency Team on enforcement matters. Where a tenant is forced to enter into a zero deposit arrangement, this may be a breach of the Tenant Fees Act 2019, a spokesperson said. Clive Betts, Labour MP and chair of the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, said: For some people, these schemes will allow people to get a property that they couldnt. But the schemes ought to be open and transparent, and people shouldnt be pressurised into adopting them. If there is mis-selling of a product the regulator ought to be clamping down on that straight away. *Judys name has been changed to protect her identity","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2021\/oct\/15\/how-should-our-workplaces-look-post-pandemic-far-better","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2021\/oct\/15\/how-should-our-workplaces-look-post-pandemic-far-better","DATE":"2021-10-15 00:57:22","PLAIN_TEXT":"On Monday, for the first time after four months of hard lockdown in Sydney, I visited a shopping centre. The experience of receiving in-person expert advice on whether new bowls could be microwaved or a doorbell installed without a drill was, though, a joy tempered. There was a palpable tension at Kmart that long, socially-distanced queues might go Thunderdome very quickly. Staff trying to enforce confirmation-of-vaccine checks and QR sign-ins did so with awkward courage. The realisation that dawned over the course of my outing wasnt that it was Covid-safe obligations flavouring the dynamics of these staff. It was two things that can be true simultaneously. The first is that people are grateful to be returning to work and earning money from their labour. The second is that, as a result of these transformative months in a disrupted Covid economy, workers in every industry have had opportunities to think about the nature of their labour, and what their ongoing dissatisfactions are with it. Related: Australias minimum wage rises 2.5% but increase delayed for pandemic-hit industries Customer weirdness and hostility was, alas, a consistent feature of the service worker experience across all industries, long before the new props and costumes of virus management turned up. And yet service workers - in retail but also in hospitality and carework, in particular - remain among the most insecurely-employed, unfairly-remunerated and over-casualised groups of workers in Australia. Dissatisfaction towards pre-pandemic work conditions was borne out in a survey of retail workers this week. One in 10 Australian workers are employed in retail, yet chaotic shift assignments - these days often assigned by computer - combined with unstable hours and eroding pay conditions, have left vast swathes of workers stressed by an inability to maintain paid employment while meeting external care commitments. The survey revealed this had such a negative impact on employee morale that its tangible risk to productivity has even employer groups now signalling willingness to work with unions to address concerns. Wise move. The monthstimeless eternity spent in lockdown has obliged a massive rethink about what workplaces should look like in all sectors of the economy - and the growing conclusion actually, far better than this has contributing to labour shortages across the world. In the US, job quits are at an all-time high. A refusal of workers to accept existing conditions in British industries has collapsed parts of the supply chain; job vacancies there are also at a record high. Criticism is growing louder of corporate values that frame Australias industrial relations system There are global lessons of coronavirus, and all of them have ramifications for the workplace. While corporate consultants may be thrilled by the cost-centre-reducing potential of Zoom conferencing, thinking and feeling human beings have learned that prosperity and survival depends on a wide and well-resourced, service-focused state. Family care relationships have been recognised not as a burden but as an actual necessity for ongoing psychological health - just ask anyone whos been separated from their family by events. Similarly, personal variations on the need to socialise, travel, self-develop and to connect with nature or community have occurred to individuals as far more meaningful experiences than rat-race-style obsessions with work. Of note in the retail survey was that more than 80% of men working in the sector wanted more job security in order to invest more of their own time in childcare. This is a consistent pattern. Rightful criticism is growing louder of the dominance of corporate values that frame Australias industrial relations system, in which labour flexibility is understood entirely in terms of employer convenience and a supply of cheap labour. Related: The big idea: should we work less? In the (hopefully) post-pandemic era, the growing realisation among workers is that labour flexibility can and should mean theyre empowered by meaningful structural changes to the workplace and systems to maximise their own productivity. It certainly shouldnt mean what it has: the inflexible imposition of practices that compromise worker safety or restrict their capacity to negotiate conditions and pay. In other countries, demands for a shorter work week are being heard. The state has and should use the capacity to create government jobs that not only address the obvious service needs of the community but that offer jobs that dont have to be full-time, that can exist as hybrids of work and welfare, and ensure consistent living standards across the economy, and do so fairly. Corporate and other employers have already accepted there are efficiency benefits to remote working and allowing work-sharing between the office and home, but there are bigger conversations needed about community care models that oblige workplace care - not only in the rarefied environments of professional offices, but with structured, formal relationships to sectors - like retail, like hospitality - that heave with workers who need the support. Workplace change is not brought about by wishful thinking, nor by moral arguments made to institutions. Organising through unions remains as ever what obliges employers into action. Yes, its known there are ultimate cost savings for employers that foster workplaces that improve morale, reduce absenteeism and turnover and facilitate greater productivity - but stasis remains the easy default for a managerial laziness class who have nothing to lose from business-as-usual. Industrial inaction remains easier for workers too, of course - but as we emerge from the enforced inertia of Covid lockdowns, one wonders if a restless energy to enjoy the world again may mobilise local demands for something better.

During the level-3 lockdown in New Zealand last year, a study of people working from home showed that 89% wanted to continue in some form post-lockdown - but by June, when most restrictions had been lifted, almost the same number of employees had gone back to the workplace. A year later, Dr Paula OKane, a specialist in organisational behaviour and human resource management at Otago Universitys department of management, is working on a follow-up study. I worry that New Zealand has missed the opportunity for change, she says, suspecting that the earlier level-4 lockdown wasnt long enough to embed more flexible working practices within organisations. Related: A land divided by climate extremes: what the IPCC report says about New Zealand Though people are talking more about the idea of working from home, OKane says, the bigger picture is around how we embrace flexibility - whether thats to do with where people work, the number of hours they work, when they work or compressed hours or a four-day working week. I dont see a lot of shift in these areas. Jacinda Ardern watches as speaker Trevor Mallard rides down a childrens slide at the opening of a play area in the grounds of parliament in late 2019. Photograph: Nick PerryAP The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, suggested last year that a four-day week could help increase productivity and domestic tourism as well as improving work-life balance, but there is little sign it has been taken up beyond about five companies, including estate planners Perpetual Guardian and multinational conglomerate Unilever, which is currently in the middle of a 12-month trial. Offering flexible hours and working from home can help employers to retain employees and save on recruitment costs. It can also improve diversity by widening the area in which workers can live, and there is gathering evidence worldwide that it increases productivity. In the UK, a Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development study in September surveyed more than 1,000 employers and found that 65% said home workers were more or as productive as when they were in the office. Staff working flexibly are also happier and take fewer sick days, save money on commuting costs and spend more time with their families.

A mixed picture Benedict Ferguson, president of the Public Service Association, New Zealands largest union, says the lockdown had a mixed impact on his members. Some organisations have embraced remote working and working from home, some have gone for a hybrid approach in which they want you in the office on certain days, but others have said, Right, back to the office. He estimates that a third of his members are unhappy with the amount of time theyre still in the office. The vast majority of staff at Datacom, an IT services company with more than 3,000 employees in New Zealand, are now hybrid workers spending some days in the office, some working remotely and some on site with clients. I doubt well ever go back to full-time office-based work at this point, a spokesperson says. There are too many advantages to hybrid working. We have software designers and coders who do a lot of focused work, and they can work from home without interruptions. We also need fewer desks so weve sublet space in our Auckland and Wellington offices. But Steve, a data analyst in his 20s and a national delegate with the Public Service Association, says that despite internal data at his company showing improved productivity when people worked from home, after the lockdown, we were straight back to working how we were before - it was a mass return to the office. Related: Five teenage boys die in New Zealands worst car accident for five years All New Zealand employees can request flexible working arrangements but Steve says most workers in his office who applied were declined because of unexplained business needs requiring them to be in the office. Its incredibly frustrating. It looks like a hierarchical policy too as you see managers and team leaders able to work at home but not staff members. OKane says that organisational culture, trust and the need to control people are the main barriers from companies to more flexible working. Managers need to be able to set output-based goals that arent about the amount of time you spend at work, she says. Its getting that mindset to shift to how we measure productivity.

Photograph: Fiona GoodallGetty Images Alexandra Tidy, a general manager at Drake New Zealand, a leading recruitment agency, says it has seen an increase in office-based candidates asking whether roles can be remotely based or flexible. And because of the countrys job candidate and skills shortages, which have been made worse by the closed borders - in April, for example, there were 86 roles across 10 sectors that had an undersupply of workers - companies need to make sure their overall offering is of interest to the market, she says. This could include flexibility, working from home, additional benefits, development opportunities and more. Related: The rabbit of the sky: flocks of Canada geese plague New Zealand countryside The script has to change Despite all the much-touted benefits of working from home, Chloe Swarbrick, the Green MP for Auckland Central, says it isnt for everyone. Some employees Ive spoken to in the big office blocks find it quite difficult. Theres a blurred line around what is work life and home life. Also the amenities that they then have to use, such as their phone, their power and internet bills, increase. Swarbrick says there needs to be a broader discussion about changing the way New Zealanders work. In fact its still a case of how do you extract as much productivity as possible and then get a massage at the end of the week? That script has still to change. In particular, she would like to see the country grapple with the reality of the gig economy to provide security and meaningful income. There needs to be a guaranteed minimum income in this country. But she is optimistic that there is still an opportunity for work-life reform. The pandemic has taught us that all these things we were told were impossible were able to happen effectively overnight - providing housing for the homeless, increasing benefit payments, freezing rents and flexible working arrangements.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/oct\/04\/woman-made-to-wait-20-hours-for-rac-rescue-had-to-shelter-with-strangers","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/oct\/04\/woman-made-to-wait-20-hours-for-rac-rescue-had-to-shelter-with-strangers","DATE":"2022-10-04 05:00:27","PLAIN_TEXT":"A 62-year-old woman had to spend the night in a strangers house when the RAC took 20 hours to recover her stranded car after it broke down in a remote country lane. Harriet OBrien said she was repeatedly promised help within the hour after her engine failed on a remote Gloucestershire lane an hours drive from her home. Six hours later, she says she was told that a recovery vehicle was on its way and she would be charged for another call-out if she took a taxi home for the night before it arrived. The patrol finally arrived at 11am the following morning, 20 hours after she had called the RAC - which promises customers complete peace of mind - for help. I received various texts telling me the RAC was working with a trusted partner who would contact me, but no one did, she said. I emphasised that I was a lone woman on a narrow country lane and each time I called, I was told I was next on the list. At 10.45pm when Id been waiting eight hours, I was called by a driver sent from a recovery firm in Newport to say he couldnt get his truck down the lane and that theyd send a smaller vehicle. An hour later, I was told the contractor needed permission from the RAC to send a smaller truck but no one was answering the phone. I tried calling the RAC myself for an hour but couldnt get through. The recovery firm then told me they had no more trucks available that night. It was nearly 1am, there was no chance of a taxi and I had to wake a couple living on the lane who had been making me tea during my wait and they let me stay the night. Interactive OBrien had to wait a further five hours the following morning after her case was erroneously de-escalated from priority status by the RAC. Reports of long waits for breakdown recovery services have rocketed in the last three years, according to the complaints website Resolver, despite premium increases of up to 30% this year. Whats most frustrating is that its a relatively closed market to competition, because of the startup costs of competing with the RAC and AA who dominate it, said a Resolver spokesperson, Martyn James. Hilary Prosser and her husband were also left stranded overnight hundreds of miles from home when an RAC patrol classed a tyre puncture as a road traffic accident (RTA) and refused to assist. Prosser called the RAC when a protruding flint wall punctured a tyre during a weekend in Cornwall and the couple were unable to remove the wheel nut. I was told the expected wait would be 270 minutes and text messages arrived every 15 minutes stating that Id get another update within 30 minutes, she said. The patrol arrived at 8.45pm after a wait of nearly five hours and told us that since the puncture was in the wall of the tyre it counted as an RTA and was not covered by my policy. He drove off, leaving us with a number for a flatbed truck company, and we had to find accommodation for the night. Prosser had to pay PS270 for the car to be towed to a garage the following morning. If I had not been paying PS39.75 a month for breakdown cover, I wouldve gone straight to the local services saving a considerable amount of money and stress, she said. Staff lay-offs during lockdown have left breakdown insurance providers reliant on local garages to supplement their vehicle recovery patrols, but garages claim that low rates paid by breakdown insurers, high fuel costs and driver shortages have left them struggling to fulfil demand. Providing a service for the vehicle breakdown work providers can be financial suicide due to poor rates being paid, said a spokesperson for the Association of Vehicle Recovery Operators. It is only recently that some providers have increased their rates in an attempt to ensure a timely service to their customers, but this has led to our industry cherrypicking the best paid jobs and ignoring the rest. The RAC said it has built positive long-term relationships with its contractors and is helping them to cope with rising costs. The pandemic and the driver shortage have put enormous pressure on the independent recovery sector, so much so that it presents difficulties for all breakdown companies, said a spokesperson. Stranded motorists who endure long delays have no recourse if their breakdown insurer fails to resolve a complaint, because the provision of roadside assistance is unregulated. The Financial Ombudsman Service is therefore unable to consider complaints about poor service and the RAC is not signed up to an alternative dispute resolution scheme. The AA said it subscribes to the National Conciliation Service, although customers arent informed of that on its complaints webpage. The RAC agreed to pay OBrien compensation for her ordeal after the Guardian intervened. A spokesperson said: Unfortunately, as well as being extremely busy we wrongly assigned her breakdown to one of our contractors rather than a local patrol which meant we sent a recovery vehicle that was too big for the narrow road. The RAC said it had incorrectly classed Prossers puncture as an RTA and it has refunded her policy premiums and costs and paid for the new tyre.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/dec\/04\/why-are-so-many-people-leaving-the-workforce-amid-a-uk-cost-of-living-crisis","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/dec\/04\/why-are-so-many-people-leaving-the-workforce-amid-a-uk-cost-of-living-crisis","DATE":"2022-12-04 11:23:03","PLAIN_TEXT":"Something odd is going on in Britains jobs market. Even as unemployment hovers close to its lowest level since the mid-1970s and businesses across the country struggle to recruit enough staff to fill roles, growing numbers are quitting the workforce altogether. The rise of economic inactivity - when working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one - is one of the biggest challenges facing the economy as the country grapples with the twin threats of rampant inflation and weaker economic growth. Both are influenced by the loss of more than 600,000 missing workers since the Covid pandemic. The number of people leaving work to unemployment in the most recent official figures from the Office for National Statistics was below a quarter of a million for the first time on record, according to experts at the Institute for Employment Studies. More than twice as many people left work to economic inactivity, meaning they are not only not working, they are not looking for a job either. More than 9 million people between the ages of 16 and 64 are now outside the labour market altogether, a group made up of students, those with long-term health conditions, early retirees and carers for young children or elderly relatives. No other advanced economy has failed to return employment back to its pre-pandemic level, with the UK an international outlier. Its a trend that has leading economists puzzled. Its a puzzle because, in principle, as higher wages are offered - alongside the worst hit to living standards since the middle of the last century - that should bring more people back into the labour market. Put simply, if people are not working, how are they managing to cope with the cost of living emergency? In search of some answers the government has kicked off an inquiry, while economists the world over are examining the question. Business leaders fear Rishi Sunak has, so far, failed to grasp the severity of the situation. One of the main drivers identified by economists is Britains faltering public services Economists see a mixture of reasons behind the trend, with positive and negative factors taking people out of the jobs market. Many would happily work if their circumstances allowed. For others, work is a four-letter word they would rather forget. One of the main drivers identified by economists is Britains faltering public services. Lengthy NHS waiting lists, inadequate support for those with health conditions and disabilities, as well as long Covid, are often cited. The lack of affordable childcare and support for elderly relatives, or intransigence from employers refusing to offer flexible work, are other frequent complaints. It is this group that has grown most since the coronavirus pandemic to record levels, with more than 2.5 million working-age adults now long-term sick. For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, health gains helping to grow the size of the workforce have gone into reverse, according to the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane. Part of this is down to the steady erosion of public services after 12 years of Conservative government. Its a trend that has exposed as fantasy the Tory dogma that slashing back the state is always positive for the economy. Lack of affordable childcare is one reason why people are leaving the workforce. Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA At the other end, the boom in early retirement could suggest a growing number of over-50s feel financially secure enough to quit work. After years of rapid house price growth, for those lucky enough to have paid down a mortgage, quitting the rat race makes perfect sense. Surveys from the ONS show most 50- to 65-year-olds who have left work since the pandemic own their homes outright and are more likely to be debt free. Places where economic inactivity has risen most are typically more affluent. The UKs biggest leap since the end of 2019 has been in Chichester, in West Sussex, followed by parts of Devon and Surrey. However, rises have also been large in places such as Preston and Mansfield - areas with similarly ageing but less affluent populations. A reassessment of our working lives may have taken place since the shock of the Covid pandemic. The ONS said those closer to 50 are more likely to consider returning to work from their early retirement. However, there is a preference for more flexible hours, good pay and the ability to work from home. Some commentators suggest welfare has played a role, with the Spectator highlighting that more than 5.2 million people receive out-of-work benefits. The clear suggestion is that a life on the dole has become preferable to work, and that slashing benefits or limiting eligibility could fix the UKs worker shortage. However, the figure neglects that about 3.3 million of these claimants were either on incapacity benefits or had no work requirement under the universal credit regime. This means they are exempt from having to find work because of disabilities, caring responsibilities, or they are above the state pension age. It is also based on the assumption that less than PS400 a month for a single adult over 25 is somehow enough to keep millions from work out of choice. The figure is close to 10% of the average wage, making it one of the least generous out-of-work benefits among rich countries. Even after the government announced it would raise benefits by the rate of inflation from April - an increase of more than 10% - the basic rate will still remain at its lowest in real terms for 40 years. This barely clears destitution levels for some adults, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity working to solve UK poverty. What is clear is that the absence of workers is a big problem for the UK. In the decade up to the Covid pandemic, the economy benefited from rising workforce participation underpinning growth, at a time when productivity gains flatlined. Now, without growth in the workforce or sufficient improvements in productivity, Britain is stuck in a low-growth cycle. To escape this, employers will need to do more to entice people back to work - through higher pay and flexible and better working conditions. The government must also play a role, with more investment in training, employment support, and to improve public services so people can be supported to work. Failure to act will condemn the country to its current growth trap.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/commentisfree\/2021\/sep\/19\/australians-are-working-from-home-much-more-because-of-the-pandemic-and-it-sucks","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/commentisfree\/2021\/sep\/19\/australians-are-working-from-home-much-more-because-of-the-pandemic-and-it-sucks","DATE":"2021-09-18 20:00:17","PLAIN_TEXT":"Working from home is great because it removes the commute, provides you with more time to be with your family and ends distracting chats with colleagues who reduce your productivity. The only problem is it absolutely sucks. It sucks because it removes the commute and blurs the lines between work and family life, and it ends the ability for you to have fun chats with your colleagues. If, like me, you are one of the many people in lockdown on the south-east of Australia you will find much that is familiar in the Productivity Commissions Working from Home report released this week. Related: The roads less travelled: how the pandemic lured Australians from the city to the country Prior to the pandemic around 20% of all businesses had staff working from home; since the pandemic that has increased to 44%. The commission argues it is unlikely that we will return to pre-pandemic levels. If the graph does not display then click here So get used to longer days. One study cited in the report found that the length of the average workday increased by around 8%, or almost 49 minutes, relative to pre-pandemic levels. This highlights that for any benefits of working from home there are many negatives. The most common way many will have come across the report is from a slightly clickbait tweet by the ABC asking Would you take a pay cut to keep working from home?. If, like everyone who replied to the tweet, you are shouting some version of Oh hell, no!, just know even the Productivity Commission agrees with you. Rather than suggest we would take a pay cut, the report merely noted that experimental data from the US suggests that this might be the case. But the commission concluded rather dismissively that the valuations expressed in surveys do not always translate into real world behaviour and that nominal wage reductions are uncommon. As such, it doubted whether a negotiated pay reduction would be a realistic outcome. Of course, there are some people who would choose a job that pays less if it allowed them to work from home, but the report concluded this is unlikely to be widespread. And given working from home will in time increase productivity, the commission suggested the wages of those working from home are likely to improve. The report looked at how working from home affects an array of aspects, from productivity to congestion, workplace health and safety, and workers wellbeing. What it found were a lot of plusses and minuses. It notes for example that less interruption from colleagues increases productivity, but also that working from home reduces productivity due to distractions or a lack of a suitable working space, and that because you engage in less socialising with colleagues you suffer increased isolation. As I am sure most of you currently in lockdown can attest, working from home also causes a blurring of lines between home and work, leading to extra hours of work and inability to switch off. Of course, in reality the majority of jobs cannot be done from home. For the most part we are talking about managers, professional and clerical workers. The report notes that even if everyone who could work from home one or two days a week actually did so, that would still mean only 13% of all hours worked in Australia would be done remotely. But that does not mean we should ignore the risks to workers. Related: None of this is normal or sustainable: the impossibility of working from home without childcare in lockdown So long as businesses continue to favour working from home as a means of saving costs the concern will be that it becomes more of a forced situation than a negotiated one. With working from home comes questions of who pays - occupational health and safety laws dont end just because an employee works from home, and businesses will still be responsible for some equipment. While pay may not diminish, there will likely be a fall in opportunities for advancement, work conditions, and worker wellbeing. And all the while you could be expected to work longer and always be on call. As such the commission concludes that it will be important for firms, employees and governments to monitor these issues, particularly if working from home continues to grow. Expect working from home to become a much greater element of the industrial relations debate from now on. * The graph in this article was amended on 22 September 2021 to correct the figure for education staff working from home before the pandemic.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2023\/feb\/14\/spanish-eco-village-paraside-leave","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/feb\/14\/spanish-eco-village-paraside-leave","DATE":"2023-02-14 10:23:25","PLAIN_TEXT":"I take one last look at the lush valley below me. A tall palm tree sways in the soft warm breeze. A group of young people are working on one of the many vegetable and fruit terraces, their laughter mixing with the sound of water in the riverbed below. I tell myself that one day I will be back. But for now, it is goodbye. Im leaving the eco-village in southern Spain, this cluster of old, whitewashed houses set in a green valley where Ive spent the past six years. My partner and I first arrived in Los Molinos - in Almeria province, the driest part of Spain - in 2006, after a long spell in north London. Our experience of eco-living was limited to regular recycling and buying biodegradable laundry and bathroom products. In Spain, we had to learn how to live completely off-grid. All our electricity came from the array of solar panels in the garden, which meant we couldnt have energy-hungry devices such as toasters and electric kettles. We even had to forgo the internet because there was no connection. The solar panels in the garden Photograph: Andrew Wilson The water that supplied our house was drawn from a stream by means of a solar-powered electric pump. We had to navigate the outside compost loo, making sure that we directed our urine into a trough, away from the chamber for solid waste; the combination of the two would produce an almighty stink. We learned Spanish, harvested olives, grapes and pomegranates, and grew a whole variety of vegetables. And in many ways it was paradise. The sun shone most of the year. The other villagers had fascinating life experiences and there was a great sense of community. I made friends with a wide range of people from around the world, the kind of people I would never have met in my north London bubble. And yet after six years, we knew it was time to leave. Our parents, back in the UK, were getting older and would need support. As a writer I could work anywhere - indeed, while in the eco-village I finished a crime novel and wrote two biographies - but my partner, Marcus, felt he needed to return to Britain to continue his work as a journalist. When we came back the contrast between the clear, bright blue skies of Andalucia and the seemingly ubiquitous blanket of grey cloud that covered England was a shock. Almost immediately, we missed the easy charms of Spanish living: the cheap wine and the delicious tapas that would accompany each glass; the wild landscape with its vast empty spaces that seemed to stretch for ever. The experience of eco-living was not wasted, however. I drew on those six years living in Spain for my new psychological thriller, Murder Grove, written under the pseudonym EV Adamson. Its about a young couple, Mia and Rich, who leave London to live in an eco-village where their green dream turns into a nightmare. Related: At 35, I found out I had gout. Imagine having to give up everything you like to eat and drink | Daniel Lavelle The experience proved inspirational in other ways, too. While living in Los Molinos, we learned how to make cheap, nutritious vegetarian dishes. We coped without central heating, and survived the harsh winter nights - when temperatures can drop below zero - by stuffing the bed with multiple hot-water bottles and wearing bobble hats. When the sun didnt shine we had so little electricity that sometimes wed have to read by candlelight. As the cost of living continues to rise, Ill be able to draw on these experiences. I like to think we brought a little bit of Spain back with us. We paid for the passage of our four rescue cats, one of whom we still have. Each time I look at this ginger tom - occasionally addressing him in Spanish - Im reminded of my time in that eco-paradise and the lessons it taught me.

Research I have undertaken suggests there is a widespread appetite for a new paradigm - one that will have far-reaching implications for cities, businesses and people. If the Covid-19 crisis subsides and economies can largely reopen, the experiences of so many people working from home over the past year will surely shape what happens next. For many of us, this could emerge as a return to the office for three days a week. Patterns will obviously vary, but a common thread would be something like Monday, Tuesday and Thursday in the office and Wednesday and Friday at home. This is the classic 3-2 plan that large firms such as Google, Salesforce, Facebook, and HSBC have already announced. From my discussions with hundreds of managers across different industries, many other companies are working towards similar arrangements. This coming shift will largely be driven by employers making a calculation between two different, equally important forces. One is what companies see as the need for in-person creativity and connections, which will spur their desire to bring people back into offices. For many, we are at our most creative working face to face, meeting people, talking over lunch and coffee, or gathering in groups. This is why some of the worlds most successful companies, be it in London, New York or Silicon Valley, build such beautiful offices. Leading companies want to lure their employees into work because they believe thats how to maximise their staffs creativity and endeavour. Perhaps, too, there is the lingering notion for some that it is easier to keep an eye on staff with them all in the same place. There is the potential for something ineffable to be lost when colleagues dont meet in person. Indeed, a recent study by Microsoft shows that employees at home are more likely to contact current team members but less likely to get in touch with new ones. So, working from home limits our ability to connect with different teams, reduces cohesion and may hinder the potential to create new ideas. At home, however, we tend to be more efficient in the daily tasks that make up much of working life. This is the competing force that may keep many of us out of the office, even after Covid. Working at home under the right conditions - which means in your own room with good broadband and no children around (which wasnt necessarily possible for everyone in lockdown) - can be highly efficient. In a large randomised control trial I carried out on working from home in 2010, I found home-based employees were 13% more efficient. When we interviewed employees after the study, they told us how noisy and distracting the office can be. The most memorable story was the individual who complained about their cubicle neighbour cutting their toenails at work under the desk with a massive clipper. This greater efficiency on current tasks also combines with other factors, like the time saved by avoiding the daily commute, offering a compelling reason for people to stay at home. The past year of Covid home working has perhaps opened many more peoples eyes to this. As companies come to decisions on new working arrangements, they will be essentially making a basic trade-off: the expectation of greater creativity in new projects at the office, but greater productivity on existing tasks at home. And, as with most trade-offs, the right answer is not all or nothing - five days or zero days at home - but something in the middle. It seems, from talking to more than 100 firms, this would be three days a week in the office. Employees seem to prefer this working pattern too. In a recent survey of 5,000 employees in Britain that I did with Paul Mizen and Shivani Taneja, from Nottingham University, working in the office for three days a week was the most popular choice. Indeed, employees reported they regarded this as a perk worth about 6% of wages. Not only is this pattern more efficient for companies, then, but it also helps to keep employees happy and motivated. Or to put it in cash terms, if your company wants to force employees back into the office for five days a week it will need to compensate them - or face losing staff when economies recover. Successfully navigating this trade-off means companies could maximise performance and profits, and employees could be happiest by splitting time almost evenly between days in the office and days at home. Not surprisingly this appears to be becoming the most popular option for many businesses. If this wider shift happens as I expect it to, the long-term move towards greater homeworking has huge implications for our cities, reversing long-ingrained thinking about working and urban life. If we now need a home office but only need to commute three days a week, the recent flight by some to the suburbs and elsewhere during the pandemic is likely to become permanent. The centres of cities might return to their early 2000s state - lower density, cheaper, somewhat more bohemian and varied. Skyscrapers, in particular, are facing the most radical change. High-rise buildings in city centres have the double challenge of public transport and lifts. Post-pandemic, many of us will still be nervous about the density of people in any given circumstances. In our survey of UK employees, over three-quarters of respondents reported feeling uneasy about taking crowded tube trains or stepping into packed lifts. So tower blocks will have to cut rents, reduce density, and even convert some floors into flats to reduce crowding - and to find new income. They will also need to get creative about working hours. To avoid the daily morning and evening crush, more companies will have to move away from the 9 to 5 schedule. One office manager I spoke to was considering cutting rents and instead charging tenants peak-pricing on lifts - one pound per employee riding up between 8.30am and 9.30am or riding down between 4.30pm and 5pm - to limit the morning and evening crush. A greater shift towards working from home also has major implications for inequality, which cant be ignored, in the rush to change working practices. Only half of all employees can work from home, typically university-educated people in management, professionals or business services. Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, the other half have remained at work - or worse still, lost their jobs. In particular, workers in manufacturing, healthcare and other frontline jobs have mostly had to continue going to work five days a week: these are jobs that cannot be done at home. Its clear that the same employees who have faced the hardest time in the pandemic also wont get to enjoy working from home after it. Employers and governments should be mindful of this, and be prepared to compensate for these sacrifices. In the coming months and years, the radical shift towards working from home that occurred during the pandemic is setting up society for a new reality. For many of us, the Monday to Friday 9 to 5 daily commute will end. Instead, we will be working from home two days a week and travelling in to the office three days a week (or a formulation close to that), many of us from the suburbs and beyond. Ultimately, if this shift goes well, we have the potential to be more productive in our jobs and happier with a more balanced working life.

While the governments plans set targets for long-term expansion of nuclear, offshore wind and solar capacity, it stopped short of doing so for onshore wind. The proposals also lacked a major intervention to help households lower their gas usage by improving insulation standards. The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said Johnson had been held to ransom by backbench opposition to windfarms. Energy experts and environmental groups labelled the plan inadequate, warning it would do little to address the urgent need to tackle sky-high bills and reduce dependence on gas imports, including from Russia. The strategy did set ambitious targets for offshore wind generation, with the government raising its target from 40 to 50 gigawatts by 2030. A leaked early draft of the energy plan proposed increasing onshore wind capacity from 15GW to 45GW but the target, first reported by the i newspaper, disappeared from the final edit. Interactive Energy executives are understood to have told the prime minister during a meeting last week that onshore turbines offered the cheapest and fastest way to wean the UK off gas, the price of which has rocketed further since Russias invasion of Ukraine. But the government scrapped its initial target, apparently in response to fierce opposition from senior Tories including the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who called the turbines an eyesore. Instead, the government promised to offer a limited number of communities guaranteed lower electricity bills in exchange for supporting local windfarms. Miliband said this would do little to unblock planning restrictions that he said place a unique burden on onshore wind, which he claimed could have replaced Russian gas imports within 24 months. Under a moratorium implemented by David Camerons government in 2015, onshore windfarms in England require unanimous consent from local communities, meaning they can easily be blocked. If one person objects, it doesnt get built, Miliband told BBC Radio 4s Today programme, adding that it was easier to build an incinerator or a road in the face of local opposition. The government has rejected the cheapest, lowest cost, most secure forms of power we have ... including onshore wind. Mark Worcester of the Turley planning consultancy said: Some of the more immediate opportunities appear to have been missed. Once an onshore windfarm has secured a contract to supply energy, it can be fully operational within about two years, compared with four or five for offshore projects, according to the trade body RenewableUK. Electricity from onshore wind is also about 20% cheaper than offshore, which is in turn cheaper than nuclear or gas. Miliband accused the government of shying away from onshore not because of the national interest but because some Tory backbenchers said they didnt want it to happen. The energy security plan also came in for criticism for failing to map out a return to nationwide home energy efficiency upgrades, which have dwindled dramatically over the past decade. Since 2013, successive government cuts to support for insulation have reduced the number of installations from 2.3m to 10% of that number, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, an independent advisory organisation. But the energy security plan contained no new measures to accelerate efficiency efforts, amid a row over cost between the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk One Whitehall source said the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had been keen to use about PS300m in departmental underspend from the past few years to kickstart a programme of mass home insulations. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with whom Kwarteng has previously clashed over financial support for businesses, is understood to have preferred not to commit funding to the plan. The climate thinktank E3G said the gaps in the energy security plan meant that little had been done to address consumers energy costs or abandon fossil fuels, including gas and oil imported from Russia. This isnt an energy security strategy and will do nothing to bring down energy bills. It is a national security threat and the person who will be happiest with it is Vladimir Putin. Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, said the government had not taken the opportunity to promote demand-side energy efficiency, including via insulation - which in turn will help reduce the most significant costs and support the push for net zero. Greenpeace said the plans were completely inadequate, while the Association for Renewable Energy &amp; Clean Technology said the government had failed to rise to the challenge facing the country.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/feb\/26\/newcastle-labour-leader-nick-forbes-austerity","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/feb\/26\/newcastle-labour-leader-nick-forbes-austerity","DATE":"2022-02-26 08:00:39","PLAIN_TEXT":"Political talent is in short supply. So is a willingness to step up and take the burdens and the blows of office. The leader of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, has been toppled as a result of destructive tribal shenanigans, likely to deter others from giving up most of their life to become councillors. All political careers end in failure, goes the old dictum, and its usually so. But Forbess career has been no failure. As leader of the council for 11 years, he steered his city through the lost decades savage cuts, protecting vulnerable people where he could and upholding Newcastles pride with ingenuity and political imagination. One of a generation of outstanding Labour council leaders, he was deselected from his seat in Arthurs Hill ward, which he represented for 22 years, after an ambush this month. His deselection is reported to have been the result of a clash with the former Labour chief whip, local MP Nick Brown. Rules may have been breached in the process, and the party will investigate, ChronicleLive reports. But Forbes prefers to walk away with his dignity intact, he tells me, not fight over rulebooks. Whats more, his tenure in office shouldnt be defined by the petty factionalism that ended it, but by the hard task of preserving his city in an age of austerity, against vicious odds. Does his downfall show he was a failure? Financially, some might say: at 48, he received total pay of PS27,600 a year, with no pension, for the past 11 years for heavy responsibilities. But he walks away reflecting on how he navigated killer cuts of 40% of Westminster funding. Labour leaders are trapped by the Tories gleeful ploy to devolve the axe, forcing local authorities to make agonising choices with shrunken budgets, taking the full blast of local blame. Right from 2010, Labour cities - the poorest places - took the hardest hit, Tory shires the least. Now with levelling up, funds again are diverted to Tory towns - often not the poorest - rather than the most deprived cities. What should they do? Protest, certainly. But they still have to carry out the cuts, find clever ways to raise funds and try to protect the weakest. Thats our tightrope, Forbes tells me, to highlight the hardship of cuts without damaging the citys reputation. At election time, despite the blows, they still have to proclaim achievements - and Newcastle still dazzles its visitors. Survival meant dealing with the enemy: he struck an early city deal with central government, he tells me, allowing Newcastle to keep business rates fixed for 25 years and to borrow to build. He also claims that they have built more council housing in the last 10 years than in the previous 30. Aggressively pursuing vacant owners, hundreds of empty properties have been brought back into use. Defending families against the monstrous bedroom tax, they built homes with a hobby room rather than a spare bedroom. With the 2011 abolition of the education maintenance allowance, which supported poor children staying on in sixth forms, they found PS15 a week for the neediest. Related: The case of the Coventry bin-lorry drivers strike should raise a red flag for Labour | Owen Jones Newcastle council had a living wage long before the rest of the UK. Partnerships with the private sector have been key: that includes a good work pledge, where hundreds of employers agree union representation, pensions and no zero-hours contracts. The government dismantled the welfare state, so we had to create our own. Of course, it was slender protection against tidal waves of poverty from the PS37bn national benefit cuts, money that was taken from pockets of the poor and from the citys economy. When a large number of Englands 3,500 Sure Starts were lost, Newcastle kept them for 30% of the poorest. Only when Forbes cut the arts did national celebs protest, not about lost nurseries and youth clubs. Newcastle is a city of sanctuary for asylum seekers and unaccompanied refugee children, despite far-right marches and demos outside mosques. Its Labour councillors were mainly male and white, now half are women, with more ethnic minority members, including the UKs first Roma councillor. As an LGBTQ+ leader, Forbes has taken shedloads of homophobic abuse. He grumbles that London-based journalists rock up in Newcastle, hear his list of the citys thriving inward investments and jobs created - but then go home to write only about grinding poverty, featuring grim up north scenes from Byker and Benwell. I plead partly guilty, because theres no escaping the brutal effects of Westminster-induced hardship, though I reported on the Forbes administrations enterprise and inventiveness too. His detractors accused him of spending too long out of his ward - but those against moderates resented his place attending moderate Keir Starmers shadow cabinet. Each shadow minister now has a local Labour leader as part of their team, at last drawing on Labours formidable local strengths. Forbes will be gone from there, no longer chairing the Convention of the North and sitting as a member of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. Forbes should be remembered not for his fall amid red-on-red factionalism, but for his public service, even in the harshest years and against the odds. What a pointless and destructive waste.

The petition is in response to an all-employee memo from the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, who last week said workers would have to come into the office for at least three days a week from September, including Tuesdays, Thursdays and a third day to be determined by individual teams. The plan is looser than previous proposals that would have forced staff to return every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, with Cook saying it would enhance the companys ability to work flexibly, while preserving the in-person collaboration that is so essential to our culture. However, a group of workers who operate under the name Apple Together have circulated a petition pushing back against Cooks orders, saying greater flexibility would promote diversity within the company. We believe that Apple should encourage, not prohibit, flexible work to build a more diverse and successful company where we can feel comfortable to think different together, the Apple petition said, according to the Financial Times. The petition added that the mandate failed to acknowledge that staff were happier and more productive with less traditional working arrangements. Are you an office-based Apple employee? Are you less than thrilled with the RTO [return to office] mandate? Sign the petition, lets stand together, the group said in a tweet linked to the petition on Monday. Apple Together reportedly intends to collect signatures this week before verifying them and sending them to the iPhone makers executives. While other tech companies such as Twitter and Facebook introduced policies at the start of the pandemic that allowed staff to permanently work from home, Apple has maintained its stance that it expected employees to return to in-person work long term. At least one high-level employee has jumped ship as a result of Apples stance. Apples director of machine learning, Ian Goodfellow, told staff in May that he was moving to Google partly because of the more flexible working arrangements. I believe strongly that more flexibility would have been the best policy for my team, Goodfellow reportedly told employees.

She told him to grab it anyway, and soon enough the Taiwanese capital was placed under restrictions amid a shock coronavirus outbreak. Her company soon sent an office-wide email saying that 50% of staff would be staying home. But it still had reminders that working from home means you are working at home and your equipment must be connected at all times, and youre expected to work eight hours and this is not a holiday, she says. Theres not a lot of trust. Taiwan has recorded more than 1,400 cases of the Kent Covid-19 variant since Friday, the first large outbreak the island has experienced since the pandemic began. On Wednesday the whole island was put on alert level 3 of a four-tier system, which includes people being asked to work remotely where possible. It has caught people unaware, and is forcing businesses to address a deeply entrenched culture of presenteeism, which demands that people must show up to be counted. Taiwanese work culture is incapable of trusting that its employees can work effectively from home, says the Taipei writer Kathy Cheng, who collects anecdotes of various attempts at or refusals to allow working from home. There are many instances where working from home is not viable, such as in Taiwans dominant manufacturing industry, and the issue often disproportionately affects lower paid and more vulnerable workers. The government says it does not want to impose a lockdown, and in the absence of a government order, companies that should be able to switch to remote working have struggled to develop concrete plans, or have instead implemented strict monitoring at work. Some have resisted entirely, and on Taipeis first working day under level 3 there was still a significant number of commuters. After the pandemic situation got serious in Taipei (and many companies have already started working from home), management still insisted its safe to commute in to the office, says one woman who works for a leading apparel manufacturer. One woman says her HR representative claimed that employees couldnt be trusted to work from home; another reports that their managers suggested snap polls to test whether people were at their desks; others have been told to enable GPS-tagging of their location when working from home. The intense distrust and resistance in the middle of a health crisis has drawn frustration. It is unfortunate, that over the last 18 months or so while the pandemic raged outside of Taiwans borders, that companies in general havent actively tried to develop contingencies and strategies for a transition to remote work, writes James Bell, founder of a Taipei food company. The level 3 alert encourages businesses to facilitate flexible work, but no financial or childcare support has been announced for parents, even after schools were ordered to close. Amanda, who did not want her real name published, appreciates her employers efforts to send workers home, but says there is no flexibility for employees who have children needing homeschooling, or for those who live close to the office and can avoid public transport. The division of who should come in and who should stay at home was also left to departments. Some are asking us to come in half the week; some are doing one week on, one week off ... youre just mixing people willy nilly, she says, adding concerns about ventilation in the sealed, air-conditioned building. Taiwan is likely to see further restrictions imposed if the outbreak isnt contained soon, and health experts have raised concerns that authorities and the population - having lived mostly without Covid for so long - are not aware of the most recent information about how it is transmitted. Not all businesses are struggling with the arrangements, however. Law firm Winkler Partners immediately closed to the public on Monday and said most staff would be working from home. Tern Bicycles Taiwan office went into working-from-home mode two weeks ago when cases started to rise, with its sales director, Matthew Davis, saying it had largely ironed out the kinks after taking similar precautions in early 2020. Weve got about 60 employees, a mixture of about 80% local staff and 20% international ... Its a challenge for everybody to get used to the different environment and switch to online-only communication, he says. [But] the bigger thing was biting the bullet and making the decision. Davis, who has lived in Taiwan for 16 years, says the culture of presenteeism was not just imposed from the top, but he hoped the current situation might prompt mass cultural change. Our focus is always on employee output and capability, not physical presence ... Our belief is thats the way forward and how to get and retain the best people. Maybe theres some efficiencies in this that lead to better work-life balance.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2021\/sep\/15\/zen-and-the-art-of-working-from-home-japanese-builder-offers-mini-office-kit","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/sep\/15\/zen-and-the-art-of-working-from-home-japanese-builder-offers-mini-office-kit","DATE":"2021-09-15 00:44:19","PLAIN_TEXT":"Japanese design is renowned for its minimalism, and for keeping things simple and uncluttered. So its no surprise that a leading housebuilder is trying to tackle the lack of space for pandemic-era working from home by marketing a tiny home-office building that can be constructed adjacent to houses in just two days, fine weather permitting. The so-called Hanare Zen is a 91cm-wide and 1.8 metre-long building equipped with power sockets, a counter-type desk and very little else. Related: British lockdown trend for shed conversions leads to spike in fires KI Star Real Estate, a popular housebuilder, began taking orders for the Hanare Zen on 6 September, hoping to find a market among those struggling to work in cramped homes. Hanare means separate or detached in Japanese, while Zenzen is written in both the Chinese character for Zen Buddhism and the alphabet. We had already created the Hanare building as a kind of storage space, and with the situation in the pandemic, the idea came about to develop the Hanare Zen as a work space, said Chisa Uchiyama, a spokesperson for KI Star Real Estate. The use of Zen in the name represents the minimalist concept of stripping down the size and features to only what is necessary. It is designed for people who have difficulty in finding a comfortable space to work in their home and dont want to get in the way of their family, added Uchiyama. A single chair fits snugly inside the tiny office Photograph: KI Star Real Estate The Hanare Zen costs 547,800 yen (PS3,600) and is available in Tokyo and the surrounding prefectures. For some of the 70% of Tokyos population that live in apartments, and would be unable to use a construction like the Hanare Zen, working in their cars has become one way to find some peace and quiet to toil in. Demand is up for a range of accessories to support in-vehicle working, including stands for computers that fit onto steering wheels, folding desks, mini-fans, portable batteries and screens for windows to block outside distractions. In Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, the Tokyu Railway Company has renovated old train carriages and converted them into remote working spaces that can be rented for 200 yen (PS1.30) an hour at its Train &amp; Bus Museum. The company has also repurposed some of its ticket kiosks at stations into shared office spaces, which it began offering for rent in July. Falling passenger numbers and sales of commuter passes due to the pandemic had reduced the demand for its ticketing services. Even after the pandemic is brought under control, 90% of Japans major corporations that have implemented teleworking intend to continue doing so, according to a survey by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper earlier this year. Though Japan hasnt imposed full lockdowns, the government has asked people who can to work from home as much as possible under the state of emergencies, to avoid crowded public transport commutes in the cities as well as reduce the chance of infections in workplaces. The current state of emergency, the fourth since the start of the pandemic, has been extended in Tokyo, Osaka and 17 other prefectures until the end of the month. In addition to cramped living quarters, a lack of digital infrastructure at many companies and the need to go into offices to stamp documents and receipts with official seals has made full teleworking difficult for many employees in the public and private sectors. On 1 September, Japan launched a new Digital Agency to address such issues and accelerate the digitisation of the economy and administrative processes at local authorities, the central government and businesses.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2021\/dec\/15\/care-workers-fast-track-visas-uk-migration-advisory-committee","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2021\/dec\/15\/care-workers-fast-track-visas-uk-migration-advisory-committee","DATE":"2021-12-15 14:01:33","PLAIN_TEXT":"The ban on allowing asylum seekers to work should be lifted and care workers should immediately be given access to fast-track visas, the governments independent advisers have recommended. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) on Wednesday said the government should release evidence backing ministers assertions that allowing claimants to work would be a pull factor for others to come to the UK. In its annual report to the home secretary, Priti Patel, the committee said there was clear evidence of the harm being caused by the ban on employment and that a change of policy was needed after the recent drownings in the Channel. Under current rules, asylum seekers are barred from working unless their claims have been outstanding for 12 months through no fault of their own. After this time, they must seek permission from the Home Office and can only apply for specified jobs on the official shortage occupation list. The immigration minister Tom Pursglove said last Wednesday that the ban must remain in place to reduce pull factors to the UK, and ensure our policies do not encourage people to undercut the resident labour force. However, Prof Brian Bell, the MAC chair, said on Wednesday he had not seen evidence to back up the pull factor assessmentand it was incumbent on ministers to make this public. Its not enough to say: Theres a pull factor. Youve got to have evidence to support that. You cant come to conclusions if youre not willing to tell us what the evidence is on one side of the equation, he said. In December 2018, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, told parliament he would like to review the ban after findings by the Lift the Ban coalition showed that allowing asylum seekers to work could generate PS42m a year for the government. In June 2021, there were about 56,600 asylum applications pending an initial decision, of which 75% had been waiting longer than six months. This compared with 33% five years ago. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, told the Spectator magazine in an interview in September he would support allowing asylum seekers to work. The committee has also recommended that those working in social care should be placed on the shortage occupation list, which was introduced after free movement of people across the EU ended in January. It also advised the jobs be made eligible under the health and care visa. The recommendation, which is usually accepted by ministers, follows months of warnings from the social care sector that it is facing severe staff shortages because of Brexit and the stipulation that all workers be vaccinated against Covid-19. In a statement, the committee said: Given the severe and increasing difficulties faced by the care sector, the report brings forward preliminary findings on adult social care. The MAC recommends the government make care workers immediately eligible for the health and care worker visa and place the occupation on the shortage occupation list. The list includes jobs where employers face a shortage of suitable labour and where it is sensible to fill those vacancies with migrant workers. Ultimately it is for the government to decide whether the recommendation is accepted. The Home Office has been approached for comment.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/may\/08\/making-a-forever-home-it-had-to-have-zing","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/may\/08\/making-a-forever-home-it-had-to-have-zing","DATE":"2022-05-08 06:00:21","PLAIN_TEXT":"Change happens slowly in the world of interiors. But even that sedately paced sector has woken up to the demand for online learning which began during the pandemic. From project management to kitchen plotting, skilful paint schemes to strategic lighting, you can now glean expert insights from architects, planners and top-flight designers from the comfort of your sofa. Sandra Harris can attest to their usefulness. Recently retired from a career in human resources, Harris had the time to redesign her golden years home in north London. With a granular grasp of detail and process, she wanted to manage the back-to-brick project herself. This included bolting on a loft extension and knocking out the back of the Victorian house. Clearly, professional help was required. Not just for the planning, but also for all the 1,001 other aspects of doing a large build: the costs involved and how to allocate my budget; how to find the right architect, contractors and suppliers, she says. Living with the blues: a one-hour virtual session with a paint consultant led to the choice of a palette of six colours throughout the house. Photograph: Rachael SmithThe Observer Lesson one was in the art of compromise. Visions of a bespoke kitchen faded as Harris realised she and her husband would have to reserve their cash for the prosaic but more important details: The flooring, glazing, the walk-in shower... She learned all this on a course run by Riba-trained architects Jane Middlehurst and Amy Poulsom of HomeNotes. Spread over four weeks, the sessions (also recorded) were an eye-opener: So many projects come off the rails because of money. The architect thinks you have X amount to spend. So does the builder. You have to be upfront about your budget, says Harris, who interviewed 13 builders for her project (she says that years of working in HR helped in the vetting process). On the course, we discussed what we wanted to achieve and how to work with an architect, and what qualities they needed for our project. I planned how we wanted the space to work for us. This is our forever home, so the bathrooms had to be future-proofed, the living rooms sociable. There was advice on designing storage - there is never enough of it in these old houses. Next it was time to shed the chromophobia. Ive always been a devotee of grey, with shades of white. This house is different. It had to have zing, so that it doesnt feel like a couple of 60-year-olds live here. Most paint companies, such as eco-specialist Edward Bulmer, Little Greene or Paint &amp; Paper Library, offer advice. A one-hour virtual session with a Farrow &amp; Ball consultant was all it took to nail the palette. Only six colours were used. Little touches connect the four-storey interior: for example, a wash of celestial blue on the bedroom panelling is echoed in the nearby bathroom. Everything feels cohesive. Playing with pattern and scale: blue panelling and complementary accessories in the bedroom. Photograph: Rachael SmithThe Observer Next, the fun stuff: shopping for sofas, rugs, lamps. During a series of 20-minute sessions with a designer at Create Academy, where they also run cookery, garden design and upholstery tutorials, Harris extracted the principles of interior design. There were tips on navigating auctions and plotting out rooms. She learned how to plan lighting circuits and how to energise a plain room with a judicious splash of pattern and to be bold with scale. I used to pick up random bits and bobs without thinking about their size and how theyd work in the room. Now a tape measure is a shopping-trip prerequisite. A few, larger pieces work better than lots of smaller things. The most encouraging lesson was the easiest. Its fine to mix your old vintage stuff with new pieces, she says, pointing to the Ikea wardrobe and midcentury lights. Ive always been interested in interiors, but Id never get rid of a sofa just because curved ones are in. I dont follow trends. I like lots of styles. I always used to be a devotee of grey: the sitting room where midcentury pieces mix with more modern items. Photograph: Rachael SmithThe Observer The kitchen is another exercise in high-low resourcefulness (she tells me that they exceeded their budget by PS1,500). Harris designed it herself using downloadable templates from DIY Kitchens, who then made the units. These were fitted by the builders, HL Workshops, who were chosen for their joinery skills. Harris used Google images to track down the vibrant, 1960s pendant lights over the island. I uploaded a photo of the light I wanted and it came up with a list of dealers who had them. One chichi site offered the lights at PS1,000 per piece. I paid PS400 for three. The sociably long dining table is a customisable design from Heals where you can specify size and finish. She sees her virtual education as part of a wider move to democratise interior design. The price of materials has shot up. Finding contractors is getting harder. But access to inspiring design - through social media - has never been easier. Many of us want to make our homes look nice and reflect our style. Zoom learning wont make you a designer. That is a skill - and a talent. But it will make you approach things differently and become more resourceful. Its empowering.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/jul\/03\/space-odyssey-creating-room-in-a-family-home-in-kent","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/jul\/03\/space-odyssey-creating-room-in-a-family-home-in-kent","DATE":"2022-07-03 06:00:07","PLAIN_TEXT":"Kingsdown House is a substantial Victorian home that sits in the shade of a mature oak a few roads back from the seafront in Tankerton, Kent. The home was built by a Dutch shipping magnate in the early 1900s and now belongs to the Wise family - Dan, Jodie and their three school-age children, Cameron, Edie and George. A suburb of Whitstable, Tankerton has become increasingly popular with families moving out of London (or DFLs- Down From London - as they are known locally). We used to live in Blackheath, explains Jodie. Whitstable was only a 50-minute drive from there, so on sunny days, when Cameron was little, we would often come here for the day. In 2016, the young family found themselves considering a more permanent move to the coast; Kingsdown House was the second property they viewed. It was that classic thing, Jodie recalls. I just got that feeling: this is the house. Warm welcome: the triple-height entrance hall. Photograph: Jo BridgesThe Observer The family spent the summer here, playing hide and seek in the rabbit warren of rooms. Shortly after, Dan was posted to Chicago for two years and the family were forced to relocate. They decided to tackle a long-distance, full-scale renovation of the house, working with their close friends, Sonya Flynn and Mark Baker of Meme Architects, to transform this three-storey, cream-and-brown behemoth into a flowing, practical and deeply luxurious family home. The work began in 2017 and took almost two years to complete. Luckily, we had Sonya and Mark to make most of the decisions on our behalf, says Jodie. They would narrow choices down for us so it wasnt completely overwhelming: WhatsApp was vital. Externally, the mock-tudor facade has been simplified. A new garage and annexe with guest accommodation has been added to the side of the house and a continuous band of charred timber cladding has been used to tie the new structure in with the main building. The windows and doors have been replaced with aluminium and, between the beams, a grey-green render balances the dark timber with the bronze finish on the window frames. The main entrance is a wide, welcoming, glass pivot door that brings you directly into a thrilling triple-height space. With their generous floorplan, the couple were able to loose a bathroom on the second floor to create this void, which has been painted entirely in deep green (Thunderbolt by Valspar). Bespoke joinery and under-seat storage conceal clutter. Storage is everything, says Jodie. You can never have enough cupboards. The entrance is overlooked by a gallery landing and a giant pendant lamp made from folds of crushed silk illuminates the space. Dinner views: the dining table in the kitchen, with garden outlook. Photograph: Jo BridgesThe Observer I wonder how the exposed entrance works when the kids come home from school and dump their bagsshoescoats: Ah, says Jodie, knowingly. We have a separate entrance for the end of the school day. Concealed in the wooden cladding is a regular-sized door that opens into a functional boot room, adjoining laundry and home gym. Here, the kids can shed their belongings before making their way through the rest of the house. Internally, the layout has been entirely reimagined. Glazing and pocket doors allow for rooms to open up or close down depending on whos home and whats happening in the house at any one time, while the bold use of rich colours conjures different moods as you move through the space. Before, I wouldnt have any sense of where the children were - it all felt very disconnected, which isnt a good feeling in your own home. From the lobby, glazed doors open on to a kids playroom. To the right is a minimalist kitchen that stretches the full width of the house. The design allows for an overflow area - a functional, yet no less elegant utility room with a wall of fridges and a glazed door that opens directly on to the front drive. At the other end of the kitchen, floor-to-ceiling glazing opens up the view of the garden, which has been cleverly zoned and planted with a combination of tree ferns native to New Zealand (Jodies homeland) and evergreen shrubs for privacy. The glazed wall continues across the back of the ground floor to form a glass corridor that carries through to the kids playroom via a sliding pocket door and into the librarystudy beyond. Dark wash: the black granite en suite. Photograph: Jo BridgesThe Observer Beyond the study, a grown-up drawing room is reached via a panelled reception hall featuring an impressive, original split staircase that rises to a galleried landing. This area was clad entirely in varnished oak when the couple first moved in, but has since been painted a moody blue (Hague Blue by Farrow &amp; Ball). The architects have replicated this original panelling and used it in each of the main rooms, creating a sense of completeness. Upstairs, a narrow, nonsensical staircase has been removed allowing space for a striking black granite en suite in the main bedroom. Next door, the smallest bedroom has been turned into a dressing room. The colourful kids rooms (two en-suite; one with access to a balcony overlooking the garden) have been arranged at just the right distance from their parents. A new staircase has been added that connects the kids rooms to the top floor, where there is an expansive games room under the eaves, a monochrome cinema room (for watching Encanto) and two generous guest bedrooms. Whats amazing, is that the house hasnt lost its original charm, explains Jodie as we end our lengthy tour. Arched doorways and stone fire surrounds have been kept intact and, at the foot of the staircase, a shiny ships compass that belonged to the original owner is embedded in the wood panelling. Having coordinated the renovation from the other side of the Atlantic, I ask Jodie how it felt to finally move in: We were desperate to come back from Chicago, because we knew this was waiting for us, Jodie says. We caught the first flight we could and it was a welcome home. We could not have been any happier.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2023\/mar\/20\/hmrc-tax-rebate-claims-firm","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2023\/mar\/20\/hmrc-tax-rebate-claims-firm","DATE":"2023-03-20 07:00:02","PLAIN_TEXT":"I wish to bring to your attention what seems to me to be an income tax refund scam. My daughter SW received a letter out of the blue from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) telling her that she was entitled to a tax refund of PS60.40 and that a cheque had been sent to Ensign Advisory. She has never heard of this company and was surprised to receive a cheque for just PS8.66. When she contacted HMRC to ask about the discrepancy between the cheque issued to Ensign and the payment, she was told that it had a signed document from her giving authority to the company to deal with her tax affairs. My daughter SW categorically did not sign any such document, but HMRC will not provide a copy without going through a subject access request.She has tried to contact Ensign but without success. The letter sent by the firm states it has sent an email that provides a breakdown of the claim but she has not received it. The reviews on Trustpilot suggest there are many people who have had a similar experiences with this company. IW, by email This rebate was a surprise for SW not only because the resulting cheque was so pitiful but because she says she had not applied for it in the first place. Ensign Advisory is an agent used by a company called Total Tax Claims. The latter says an online application for working from home tax relief was filled out by SW on its Totaltaxrefunds.co.uk website (you reach this site via clicking on ads on social media). It adds that the application was confirmed by email and text, although your daughter says she did not get them. Whatever its origin, the payout was reduced as per Ensigns fee structure which the terms and conditions on its website explain is a massive 36% of the refund issued by HMRC plus a flat administration fee of PS30 on top. This resulted in a deduction of PS51.71 with the balance of PS8.66 sent to her. The commission charged is obviously a shocker but that is not the issue here as your daughter insists she did not apply for a rebate given that she cannot do her job remotely. Ensign shared the documents relating to this claim with me. They appeared to be filled out and signed by SW. However SW says the digital signature is a fake. In a statement lawyers acting for Total Tax Claims and Ensign Advisory said the allegation it was perpetrating a scam was completely untrue. Total Tax Claims and Ensign Advisory in all cases obtain full signed written contractual mandates to obtain tax rebates for their customers. Without specific information and instructions provided by the applicant, no claim for [a] rebate can be submitted to HMRC. All fees for carrying out the work are notified and agreed by customers during sign-up. To be clear, tax rebates cannot be generated by Total Tax Claims and Ensign Advisory without the receipt of an application which contains the unique information pertaining to the particular tax payer. Either the individual in question, or someone who was motivated to obtain a tax rebate on her behalf and who additionally possessed her confidential private information, provided us with a signed mandate to obtain a rebate. They also had agreed our terms including as to charges. This rebate was supplied to the individual, by cheque made out in her name, minus the deduction of the charges. We are unable to speculate who might have made the application other than the individual herself, when only she stood to receive the monies. This case shines a light on a problem area as HMRC received more than 2,000 complaints about rebate firms last year. The issues raised by consumers include the lack of transparency in agents processes for signing up clients and high commission charges, and following a consultation the law is being tightened up. Remember you can make a tax rebate claim direct with HMRC via gov.uk; this is free and you will receive 100% of any refund. If you can show an agent has made an invalid claim on your behalf, you can report it using a form on its website. SW tried this route but got nowhere as HMRC said it had a document signed by her giving Ensign permission to act on her behalf. There are other negative reviews of Total Tax Claims and Ensign on Trustpilot however they counter that the number is small in the context of more than 300,000 customers.

I walk into a lush, green forest with my constant companion, a goat named Penny. As we tread down a winding pathway, we start to smell the rotting stench of decay. Then we see it: the corpses of other animals, decayed beyond belief, spores poking from their bodies. There are mushrooms everywhere. Its a little after 9pm and Im sitting at my kitchen table in Brooklyn, Zooming in to a fantastical journey led by Megan A Connell, a licensed psychologist who uses Dungeons &amp; Dragons during therapy groups. Shes leading me through a round of the popular tabletop game to help me notice patterns of behavior. We journey onwards. A little red structure appears, she tells me. I walk to the window and peer in, just enough to get a glimpse of who is inside while staying covert about it. I see an angry monster pacing back and forth. His face looks melted. Hes made up entirely of mushrooms that appear to be spiking straight out from his chest. She asks: do I want to approach him? No, I definitely want to run away from the crazed mushroom man. I turn on my heels, and gallop directly in the other direction. Dungeons &amp; Dragons has long been a haven for outsiders, and its evangelists say the game helps them build a community and let their imaginations roam. Since its creation in 1974, D&amp;Ds reach has expanded far beyond basement gatherings and high school lunch period meet-ups. There are now over 13 million active players worldwide, thanks in part to its inclusion in the plot of Netflixs Stranger Things and a pandemic-era boom in remote playing. A forthcoming action comedy, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, starring Chris Pine, will lure more fans into the franchise. A scene from the forthcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons film. Photograph: Landmark MediaAlamy D&amp;D diehards might tell you that no Hollywood blockbuster can compare with the theater of the mind, which is where the game thrives. Using only dice and a rough roadmap of how the game will go, players sit around a tabletop and dream up scenarios for their characters, relaying them through storytelling. You may steal treasure, kill goblins, or cast wicked spells. As players often say, the only limitation is your own imagination. According to Connell, this makes D&amp;D an ideal conduit for therapy. During our session, Connell tells me that I have a sense of curiosity that can lead me to danger - but enough self-preservation to know when to back away. (Any similarity between my game and a certain HBO mega-hit series featuring killer fungi is purely coincidental. After we play, I remind Connell that bacteria-carrying mushrooms are also the villains in The Last of Us - she had forgotten.) According to practitioners, D&amp;D can be used to treat everything from exploring gender - you can take on a character whose identity is completely foreign to yours - to recovering from traumatic events. Trauma disconnects us from ourselves, and one of the first things we get disconnected from is our imagination and creativity, Cassie Walker, a clinical social worker, told Wired last year. Role-playing has the potential to lighten up therapy sessions, and invigorate clients whose expressiveness may have been dulled by past events. Today, Connell is especially interested in working with young women and girls to use the game to build self-esteem and assertiveness through play. Its a great place to practice skills and step into those aspirational traits to be the person you want, she said.. In middle school, Connell and her friends appreciated the chance to escape into their characters. Photograph: Jill MeadThe Guardian Connell first encountered the game as a child growing up in rural Maine. Her middle school friends mostly appreciated the chance to escape into their characters. I have to put air quotes around this: we played D&amp;D, Connell said. I think we only ever played like two games. For us, it was a lot about making the characters. We talked about how cool they were, and all the adventures they got to go on. After a long hiatus from role-playing games - Connell tried becoming a musician, then switched to music therapy, ending up as an army psychologist treating soldiers with PTSD in Iraq and Fort Eustis, Virginia - Connell fell back into a regular D&amp;D game night with her family. Psychologists are historically bad at taking care of themselves, since we work on taking care of everyone around us, she said. D&amp;D was a game where I could unplug my brain and have fun. It recharged me, and I found it therapeutic. Related: Why cant anyone make a decision? My first time as a D&amp;D Dungeon Master Connell began listening to a D&amp;D podcast that featured an interview with Raffael Boccamazzo, a Seattle-based psychologist, who used the game to teach social skills to children on the autism spectrum. She learned that therapeutic D&amp;D was a burgeoning field. The practice Game to Grow, also based in Seattle, was founded in 2017 and now serves 150 clients. Another company, Geek Therapeutics, teaches therapists how to use the game in their work, and has a growing Rolodex of therapeutic game masters based around the country. But Connell says there is not enough clinical research to back up what she sees in her practice. Shes about to release a book, Tabletop Role-Playing Therapy: A Guide for the Clinician Game Master, which is full of disclaimers. Its ridiculous how much I had to say, We dont have research on this, and we dont know exactly whats going on, she said. During her book research, Connell found that there were a few case studies and pilot programs using tabletop therapy to teach social skills in the early 1980s, and the findings seemed promising. But then the research just dropped off. Connell believes this was because Satanic panic almost killed D&amp;D, as concerned parents and law enforcement tried to stamp out anything that seemed remotely connected to the occult. Tom Hanks starred in Mazes and Monsters. Photograph: Everett Collection IncAlamy In 1979, a D&amp;D prodigy and college student named James Dallas Egbert III went missing and was later found dead. Detectives ominously theorized that the game made him experience delusions that led to suicide. Mazes and Monsters, a subsequent made-for-television movie loosely based on the case, starred a very young and rather cherubic Tom Hanks. 60 Minutes aired a segment on a supposed rash of violence blamed on D&amp;D, and a parent of a fan who had killed himself unsuccessfully sued its creators. After that moral panic, studies into its effectiveness were shelved. Researchers only returned to studying therapeutic gaming in the 2000s. More foundational studies are required to track exactly how D&amp;D helps patients. But Connell says shes seen it work. Ive had several players talk to me about how getting to role-play saying no helps them do it in real life, she said. It can be really powerful learning how to stand up for yourself and have boundaries, and doing it in the game can really help translate a lived experience. Before we begin our session, Connell asks me if I have any phobias that I dont want to show up in the game - if Im afraid of spiders, for instance, she wont make the main villain a giant tarantula. I say Im game for anything except mice or rats, as Im currently dealing with an infestation in my kitchen ... which is also where Im Zooming into our meeting from. But Connell does want to see how my character, Goldie, will interact with something shes afraid of - hence the murderous mushroom man I came upon in the forest. If your character confronts something, and youre able to talk about it later, you can learn what helped your character through a panic attack, and brainstorm how to help yourself later when youre experiencing anxiety, Connell explained. After I decide Goldie wants to make a run for it, Connell asks me to roll the 20-sided dice. Shes making a survival check for my character - and luckily, Im able to find a path out of the dark woods. I get away from the fungi contagion and come upon a clear stream that leads to a small hamlet. What does my character want now? Food, I reply, and I head into the town center toward a communal oven. There, I encounter a halfling - a Tolkien-esque hobbit with pointed ears, often a sign of good luck. Using an accent that wouldnt sound out of place in a community theater production of The Banshees of Inisherin, Connell plays out our conversation. The halfling has heard of the mushroom blight a few miles south. He offers me a paltry amount of food and some silver pieces to lead a search party back down to the mushroom mans hideout. Will I go? Absolutely not. Goldie wants to stay in the town and rest for a while. We played a short game, and I didnt have any psychological breakthrough, but I imagine regular players might find the process therapeutic. It felt slightly ridiculous to picture myself - er, my character - traipsing through a forest wearing what I basically imagined to be a Daenerys Targaryen costume from Spirit Halloween. But there was something relaxing about adopting a character. It was a low-stakes way to test out behavior that the real me didnt have to commit to trying. I think about how Connell uses D&amp;D to teach young women and girls social skills and boundary-setting. I can see how that might work.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/oct\/23\/revealed-ofsted-asks-staff-from-private-care-firms-to-inspect-childrens-homes","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/oct\/23\/revealed-ofsted-asks-staff-from-private-care-firms-to-inspect-childrens-homes","DATE":"2022-10-23 06:00:31","PLAIN_TEXT":"Managers from some of the largest private childrens home chains in the UK have been asked to carry out inspections for Ofsted, despite those groups owning numerous homes that are deemed unsatisfactory. The Observer has discovered that Ofsted, which oversees standards in childrens social care, has recruited staff from the Outcomes First Group and the Keys Group to inspect homes as part of a pilot. Analysis of inspection data in Ofsteds latest annual review of social care reveals 20 homes run by both firms have been rated as less than good. A study by Oxford University found this month that for-profit childrens homes receive worse Ofsted ratings on average than local authority-run provision, with for-profit homes violating more care requirements. Anne Longfield, former Childrens Commissioner for England, said many would question the wisdom of recruiting private sector managers when there are concerns some companies are putting profits before high-quality child care. It is vital that Ofsted inspections are independent, and that confidence in their findings is not eroded by using serving managers from big private provider chains as inspectors, she said. While Ofsted has in the past used practitioners employed by schools, colleges and early years providers to carry out inspections, this is the first time the inspectorate has drafted in current staff from private social care companies. Serving practitioners are usually expected to work in provision that is rated good or above. Ofsted states potential conflicts of interest are monitored to ensure the integrity of inspections. However, a former Ofsted inspector, Ian Dickson, who has written to the watchdog to raise concerns about the scheme, said it impugned the integrity of the inspection process. Dickson said that whistleblowing members of staff could end up being inspected by a former boss, or children could be inspected by someone from a former provider they had complained about. Inspectors must go in absolutely impartially, he said. But these [serving practitioners] are still working for companies while inspecting - it is a clear conflict of interest. Anne Longfield, the former Childrens Commissioner for England, says it is vital that inspections are independent. Photograph: Gary CaltonThe Observer Become, a charity representing children in care, said young people should have been consulted on the change as it could impact on their care. Given that 80% of homes are run by the private sector, it feels like marking your own homework, and calls into question the independence of the regulatory system, said Clare Bracey, policy director at Become. The Outcomes First Group, the fourth biggest provider in England, with 60 homes, made a profit of PS5.9m in 2021. It is owned by Stirling Square Capital Partners Jersey, a private equity company based in Jersey, where the standard rate of company tax is zero. Seven of 21 (33%) of the groups homes inspected in 2021-22 required improvement. One of the firms homes in Lincolnshire was rated as inadequate after inspectors found unsafe staff caring for children and an epileptic child left unsupervised. Twelve of the groups homes were rated as good and one was rated as outstanding over the same period. The Keys Group, the third biggest provider in England, with more than 100 homes, received more than PS110m from councils last year. It is owned by G Square Healthcare Private Equity, which made a profit of PS3m from its portfolio of investments, including the Keys Group, for its owners in March. Just over one in 10 of its homes were deemed in need of improvement by Ofsted in 2021-22. Inspectors at a home in Shropshire found inconsistent medication record-keeping was putting children at risk and managers were not ensuring suitable people were employed to care for children. The groups other homes received higher ratings, with 67 rated good and 13 outstanding over the same period. The Outcomes First Group declined to comment and Keys Group did not respond to the Observer. An Ofsted spokesperson said it would consider all issues raised by the pilot: We are always keen to learn from, and draw on, the expertise of those working in the areas we inspect and regulate. We have been using serving practitioners in inspections of schools, further education providers and the early years sector for some time, so this is a logical next step. We have well-established procedures in place from this work, and from consultation with provider groups, to help manage any potential conflicts of interest.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/15\/the-dream-of-flexible-capitalism-became-a-nightmare-for-many-workers-but-there-is-a-path-back-to-the-sweet-spot","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/sep\/15\/the-dream-of-flexible-capitalism-became-a-nightmare-for-many-workers-but-there-is-a-path-back-to-the-sweet-spot","DATE":"2022-09-15 17:30:03","PLAIN_TEXT":"Fifteen, 20 years ago, the drift, at least culturally, seemed undeniable and unavoidable. Full-time permanent work was on the way out and instead we would all be the boss of Me Inc. Under this model workers could sell their labour to the highest bidder and free themselves from an old model of a job for life. Moving from job to job, contract to contract, work would be tied to a project or a specific task and once that was done, a workers time was their own. A 1997 essay in Fast Company magazine captured the zeitgeist under the optimistic banner of Free agent nation. In this nation, workers were free agents who could achieve a beautiful synchronicity between who you are and what you do. In the late 1990s, this new way, this model of flexible capitalism, would benefit both worker and employer, or so we were told. The worker would get previously unimagined flexibility and be able to sell their skills to the highest bidder. And the workplace wouldnt be stuck with financial and physical overheads that came with a permanent workforce - sick leave, superannuation and long-service leave. Related: There was a putrid fatberg in my home. Would I have to give my kitchen sink a colonic? | Brigid Delaney For white-collar workers, this model of flexible capitalism coincided with globalisation and new technology that allowed workers to theoretically work from anywhere. It meant that for a highly educated or in-demand sector of the economy, workers could move around the world doing contract or project work. In 2007, author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss set out the template of how to escape the 9-5, live anywhere, and join the new rich in his bestselling book The 4-Hour Workweek. Earn dollars. Live on pesos. Compensate in rupees, he wrote of this new model. And, Its too big a world to spend most of life in a cubicle. During these years, very few industries around the world were untouched by structural shifts in the workplace. But these shifts didnt always provide the glamour and freedom as touted by Ferriss. Not everyone became rich. And although there was freedom in the new model, for an insecure workforce, there was also stress. Naomi Klein wrote about the dark side of this shift in 1999s No Logo: A sense of impermanence is blowing through the labour force, destabilising everyone from office temps to high-tech independent contractors to restaurant and retail clerks. Factory jobs are being outsourced, garment jobs are morphing into home work and in every industry temporary contracts are replacing full, secure employment ... Almost every major labour battle of the last century has focused on enforced casualisation. Fast forward more than two decades and the dream of flexible capitalism has become a nightmare for many workers. The nightmare looks like this: a workplace will stick with you when demand is high and times are good but will dump you when theres a downturn, or when you get sick, or during a pandemic (Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows the rate of casuals reduced at the start of the pandemic as businesses shut down and could not afford to keep on their casuals). Or it looks like coming to the end of your working life with not enough superannuation. Or it could be a more intimate and existential issue - being bereft of community, support and acknowledgement that comes with long tenure in one place; knowing and being known by a community of colleagues over the long term. Interactive Decades ago, Fast Company, Ferris and a slew of others were excited about how technology could liberate a worker from the workplace. But today, the liberation is uneven. For every knowledge worker able to attend a Zoom meeting poolside in Bali, theres a whole new underclass of workers, such as those in the gig economy, who are managed not by humans but by an app and its algorithms and for whom the estrangement from the workplace is material as well as existential. In the gig economy, workers are free to provide their labour to multiple apps. But missing in these arrangements are the safety rails - the sick leave, the breaks, the superannuation - that existed in the old style of permanent full-time employment. But there is pushback. A recent Fair Work Commission decision ruled in favour of a Deliveroo driver who sought to have his status recognised as an employee not a contractor - and therefore be able to access these rights under unfair dismissal laws. That decision was later overturned but what is heartening is to see looser labour arrangements challenged. There has also been a pushback on outsourcing. Qantass annus horribilis - cancelled flights, lost luggage, general chaos - has been blamed in part on a restructure at the start of the pandemic, where many long-term, experienced and full-time workers were laid off and replaced with people on less pay, casuals or workers from labour hire firms. The federal court found Qantass decision to outsource the baggage handling and cleaning jobs was in breach of the Fair Work Act. In Australia we are now at a really interesting juncture. The pandemic has exposed the flaws in our current workplace structures. It was in places run by labour hire firms - such as hotel quarantine - where Covid outbreaks occurred. Related: Im off to Bali! Its like the pandemic never happened. Except it did - and it hurt us all differently | Brigid Delaney And we saw casual workers were the first to be let go in March 2020, and later more likely to go to work while sick because they werent eligible for sick leave and spread the virus. But what makes this juncture so interesting is that worker bargaining power has not been so strong for decades. This strength is talked about in terms of pay rises, but its also possible that a worker without superannuation or sick leave may be able to negotiate around their entitlements, or that a casual worker may ask to be converted to a permanent employee. In many ways the lessons of and changes wrought by the pandemic can be used to create truly modern reforms in the labour market. The pandemic has shown us that the great benefits of casual work - that is flexibility, working from home or more project-based work - can be folded into a full-time, permanent job. They dont need to be mutually exclusive. Genuine flexibility might look like working from home three days a week and in the office two days a week. Or it might look like a four-day week, or it might look like months of long weeks working on a project then a month or so of light work and hours. There is a combination of the new and old that could just hit the sweet spot and truly suit the times. We could bend the flexibility and freedom of free agent nation to suit workers, with the stability and security inherent in the old model. The pandemic has shown us where our problems lie, but it has also shown us the solutions.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2022\/mar\/22\/dozing-from-home-how-workers-have-perfected-the-art-of-napping-on-the-job","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2022\/mar\/22\/dozing-from-home-how-workers-have-perfected-the-art-of-napping-on-the-job","DATE":"2022-03-22 14:33:00","PLAIN_TEXT":"Name: Dozing from home.

Almost one in eight workers in the UK won the right to perform digital tasks remotely in 2021 by bidding for jobs on the web. The TUC says that the proportion of the working population being paid for such digital tasks at least once a week has more than doubled since 2016. Yet almost two in three microworkers - many of whom have a degree - earn less than PS4 an hour. This is not only below the minimum wage, but also less than a quarter of the median graduate starting salary. The demand for microwork has increased with the rise of artificial intelligence, which needs human input to nudge computers in the right direction. Big tech companies employ, often anonymously through platforms, workforces that control quality and train AI. This type of employment boomed during the pandemic. People who lost their jobs or their income during lockdown ended up getting work that only needed an internet connection. Now, UK-based workers seeking to supplement their income at a time of double-digit inflation see microwork as a necessary side hustle. This summer, the thinktank Autonomy warned that these unregulated models of employment are exploitative; unsurprising, perhaps, as half of the global workforce competing for these jobs is found in just three developing nations: India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Academics Phil Jones and James Muldoon found that one in five workers they interviewed relied on this precarious form of labour. A typical microwork day might consist of 30 or 40 tasks for different platforms - each lasting between 30 seconds and 20 minutes. The microworkforce is largely hidden, but Autonomys report suggests that in the UK it is young and well-educated, with more than 60% having at least a degree. Some workers do appreciate the flexibility of microwork, but the thinktank warns that many are stressed [and] burnt out by the constant hunt for tasks. Hidden beneath the claims of freedom is the fact that the platforms exercise firm control over most aspects of how, and to what standard, work is done. Workers have nowhere to go if a platform refuses to pay out. Microworkers are left defenceless because employment rights were established in a legal system designed for another age. At present there are three categories of employment status in the UK: employee, worker and independent contractor. Only the first category is entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payments, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. Digital platforms - the first was Amazons Mechanical Turk - assume their hires to be contractors. Autonomy suggests changing the law so that they are treated as workers, paid a minimum wage and given paid holidays. It also advocates a universal workers rights programme - including rights to childcare and to disconnect. This would be very welcome, but needs a shift in political thinking. Labour rights are seen, wrongly, as a constraint on the efficiency of businesses. Higher trade union membership, studies show, leads to higher productivity. For decades, policymakers have freed employers from their responsibility to workers while making workers more dependent on employers. Feelings of powerlessness fuelled working-class anger during the last decade. A precariat is being formed, with working conditions overseen by extractive technologies. Left unchecked, this would lead to a dark future for the world of work - and politics.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/aug\/09\/flexible-working-is-here-to-stay-says-kwasi-kwarteng","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/aug\/09\/flexible-working-is-here-to-stay-says-kwasi-kwarteng","DATE":"2021-08-09 12:24:20","PLAIN_TEXT":"Civil servants who continue to work from home are not at risk of having their pay cut, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has said. Kwarteng also said he thought flexible working, enabling people to carry on doing their jobs partly from home, was here to stay. The suggestion that government officials who refuse to return to the office should face a pay cut was made by an unnamed cabinet minister quoted in the Daily Mail on Monday. The minister, who wants to see more workers back at their desks, argued that penalising those staying at home would be justified because they were benefiting for not having to pay for travel. Related: UK health department plan for return to office working put on hold But Kwarteng told LBC radio he would never support the proposal from his anonymous ministerial colleague. I dont know who it was [who spoke to the Mail], Kwarteng said. I think people working from home are contributing hugely to the workforce. Asked if working from home should be allowed to continue, Kwarteng earlier told Radio 4s Today programme: I think flexible working is something that is here to stay. He continued: I think its up to employers and employees to come to their own arrangements, depending on the needs of the company, the needs of the business. I dont think it makes sense to have a government diktat telling people exactly how many hours theyre going to spend in the office and exactly how many hours theyre going spend at home. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime ministers spokesperson said there were no plans to dock the pay of officials who continued to work from home, and that flexible working was rightly being used throughout the civil service. He went on: But we will continue to encourage people to return cautiously to work over this summer period. Last summer, the government was very keen to persuade workers back into the office, with a briefing suggesting that employees who continued to work from home risked losing their jobs. But the campaign had only limited impact, and ministers had to change tack as Covid cases rose again. default Some ministers are trying the same argument again, with the Times on Monday quoting a minister saying people who stayed away from the office would be less likely to gain promotion. But Kwartengs comment about flexible working being here to stay is in line with the Conservative manifesto, which promised to encourage the practice. Asked if he would allow his own officials to continue working from home, Kwarteng said: Ill be encouraging them to come in but, of course, therell be a degree of flexibility. In his Today interview, Kwarteng said he did not think there was any chance of Boris Johnson demoting Rishi Sunak, the chancellor. At the weekend it was reported that the prime minister had floated the idea in a meeting with aides because he was angry about a letter from Sunak raising concerns about Covid travel restrictions. Callout callout-coronavirus > Asked if there was any prospect of Sunak being moved, Kwarteng said: I dont think there is, but thats up to the prime minister. I think Rishis doing a great job as chancellor. Kwarteng said creative tension was inevitable in the relationship between No 10 and No 11, but he said the bond between Johnson and Sunak was as cohesive as any relationship of that kind of that Ive seen.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/jun\/21\/cbi-city-bosses-warn-against-giving-uk-staff-legal-right-work-from-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/jun\/21\/cbi-city-bosses-warn-against-giving-uk-staff-legal-right-work-from-home","DATE":"2021-06-21 15:15:27","PLAIN_TEXT":"The heads of the UKs largest business lobby group and two major City employers have warned against giving workers the legal right to demand remote working, claiming it would harm young employees and city centre economies. Lord Bilimoria, the president of the CBI, said that while employees should be able to request the option of working from home, flexible working arrangements must be allowed to evolve in their own way. The worst thing possible would [be to] have any legislation that entitles people to the right to work from home, he said, speaking at the City Week conference on Monday. They should have the right to request it. But every employer should make that decision about the mix of working from home [and the office], he said. Downing Street confirmed last week that the government was considering legislation that would make working from home the default option by giving employees the right to request it. The CBI head said it would be harder to train new recruits within a workforce that was working remotely, echoing concerns raised by major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have taken the most hardline stance on demanding that staff return to the office. He also said cafes and restaurants would suffer unless staff got back to city centres. Sign up to the daily Business Today email. Theres so many benefits from being in the office, particularly for young people, particularly for new starters: the mentoring, what you learn, the innovation, the creativity, the buzz, Bilimoria said. All [of] that takes place when youre face-to-face in an office environment, let alone everyone else that benefits from being surrounded by an office - both the restaurants and all the other businesses that rely on an office economy. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman of the insurance market Lloyds of London, also speaking at the event, agreed with Bilimoria, saying legislation would be inappropriate and that different sectors should be allowed to adapt as they saw fit. He also raised concerns of a two-tier workforce, where people who worked from home could feel excluded if their office-based colleagues ended up getting more face-to-face time with bosses. It will take different kinds of management skills to be inclusive of people who are working remotely to the same extent as you can be in the office. This is something that needs to develop over time, Carnegie Brown added.

TiinaLee, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank UK and Ireland, told Business Insider that grads and interns should want to spend as much time in the office as they possibly can as they kick off their careers, even if it is not mandatory. Anne Richards, the chief executive of the asset manager Fidelity International, told theevent employers needed to start thinking about the office as a hub for brainstorming, collaboration and training. You dont necessarily have to be in the office five days a week, 300-odd days a year in order to do that. So I think the point that were making is to try and find the right balance, she said, adding that flexible employers who treated staff like grownups could end up having a competitive advantage in the job market.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2021\/dec\/06\/britain-drugs-crackdowns-punishment-boris-johnson","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2021\/dec\/06\/britain-drugs-crackdowns-punishment-boris-johnson","DATE":"2021-12-06 15:54:24","PLAIN_TEXT":"The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 must be the worst law ever passed by a modern parliament. Its purpose was to prevent the misuse of controlled drugs by means of a complete ban on their possession, supply, manufacture, import and export. It has plainly failed. Fifty years on, the act is variously credited with a soaring prison population, the devastation of working-class communities and creating hundreds of thousands of hardened addicts. British deaths from drug misuse are at record levels, having nearly doubled in a quarter of a century. Cocaine deaths have risen five-fold in 10 years. Fatalities per million are three times the EU rate. Narcotics are found in the lavatories of parliament, in Her Majestys prisons and in virtually every pub and nightclub in Britain. Of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this, the most glaring is that ever fiercer punishment is no deterrent and no solution. Yet no politician, certainly no prime minister, dares open their mouth on the subject without pledging tougher penalties. This week, a Boris Johnson aching for a headline proposes yet another war on drugs in which a modest increase in treatment and rehabilitation for those who repent is accompanied by a blood-curdling crackdown. He promises to dismantle 2,000 county lines drug networks, without explaining whether the 1,500 he says they have already shut down have staunched the flow of drugs into communities. The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, says that drugs lead to murder, mayhem and degradation. He omitted to say it was not consumption but his continued outlawing of the drugs market that is the principal cause of such outcomes. Meanwhile, Johnson will expand police testing for drugs, taking away driving licences and passports and imprisoning reoffenders. There is no evidence that such draconian measures ever work. Related: Middle-class drug users could lose UK passports under Boris Johnsons plans Britain is currently addicted to media-driven retribution, nearing mob rule in certain high-profile cases. The clang of prison gates is seen in Victorian terms as the answer to every social evil. This makes it difficult for those supposedly enforcing the 1971 act at the frontline to seek new remedies and reforms. Police forces such as the West Midlands have been trying - in the face of Home Office opposition - to decriminalise possession, if only to concentrate on more serious crime. But such responses do nothing to mitigate the criminal consequences of drug supply remaining illegal and unregulated. While Californias cannabis sellers are going on sommelier courses and those in the Netherlands are relieving epilepsy and depression, Britains are sent to jail. Staggering sums are traded for drugs in Britain, and staggering sums are wasted on failed suppression. The British market, reputedly worth PS9.4bn, is effectively fully deregulated. Nothing in Johnsons proposals indicates any attempt to curb, let alone license and tax, this market. He is the dealers fairy godmother. No route from the drugs problem emerges from the growing movement to put various narcotics on a par with alcohol. But with New York joining several other US states in decriminalising cannabis, and Oregon recently decriminalising possession of harder drugs, the time has surely come for research and piloting, not a retreat into yet more tabloid authoritarianism. Drugs produce an irrational reaction in Britains political community. Deep-seated prejudices and taboos are evoked, with responses dominated by a manic groping for ever more severe punishments. After 50 years of costly failure, a reasonable politician might advocate at least an open mind. In most democracies that is happening. Not in Britain.

At four, desperate to know how eggs come out of chickens, I hid inside a hen house waiting to witness it. When I finally returned, Mum had called the police. Id been missing for hours. Instead of punishing me, she listened intently to my discoveries. I was jealous of Tarzans Jane as a child. Yes, I know they were fictional. But I still felt spurned he didnt pick me. From the age of 10, I dreamed of living with animals and writing books. In my early 20s, I travelled to Kenya. Out in the Serengeti, the palaeontologist Dr Louis Leakey was impressed with me. He offered me the opportunity to study chimpanzees like nobody had before. It was destiny. I dont remember my father much. War broke out when I was young, then he was gone for good. Mum, meanwhile, encouraged me to follow my dreams. On my first expedition, in todays Tanzania, the authorities wouldnt let a woman work solo in the wild. My mother volunteered and joined me. After four months they all agreed I was crazy enough to go it alone. People often assume Im stern and serious: Dr Jane Goodall PhD DBE. Theyre surprised Ive got a wicked sense of humour. When I started out I was told animals needed numbers not names, that mind, personality and emotion were unique to humanity. To me, this was so obviously not the case. A fact anyone with a pet could attest to. I drink a whisky every night. Its a ritual. Mum and I used to have a small glass together at home. As I travelled more, wed each raise a glass at our respective 7pms. It was a way to feel connected. Now I toast her up in the clouds every evening. Of course, its for medicinal purposes. You cant solve the worlds problems, so dont try. Instead, focus on what you can do each day to leave this place a little better than you found it. We have a window of time to change this planets course, but its rapidly closing. If governments do what they say theyll do, we still have a chance. I havent cried properly since 1969. TV and film might leave me misty-eyed, but the last time I truly sobbed was when I accepted my first marriage wasnt working. My first husband, Hugo [van Lawick, the Dutch wildlife filmmaker], had his work, so couldnt stay at our research base in Gombe, Tanzania. I had my work, so couldnt leave. Therefore it was over. I regret following one chimp up a hill. Only seven years ago, I stupidly climbed a steep gravel trail, alone, with a chimp up ahead. Close to the ridge, I reached to pull myself up on a large rock, but it came free. Pressed against my chest, we rolled downwards together. Thankfully something threw me to the side. I dislocated my shoulder and cracked ribs; my face was a mess. Still, if Id tumbled further it would have been game over. My second husband died of cancer. Our marriage was short. I came to England to mourn, then returned to Tanzania spending days alone in the forest. Out in nature grief dissipated. Now I love to think of life after death; exploring that unknown will be my next great adventure. Before the pandemic, I travelled 300 days a year. Slowly Im returning to that number. Ill be 90 in a year - who knows how long I have left? Yet theres so much left to do. As long as my mind and body obey, Ill keep at it.

In many of them, staff are returning under a hybrid model, working from home a few days a week and coming in for the others. Some organisations slashed their floor space during the pandemic, making what is left feel distinctly cramped, while others have removed desks, and look a lot like departure lounges. A lot of us are hot-desking for the first time in our working lives, without a desk, chair, computer or pot plant to call our own. And people have changed, too. Much to the disgust of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, after two years of WFH we have got used to wearing jogging pants, talking to our pets, cooking our own lunches, picking children up from school and doing mid-morning naked yoga while also getting our work done. So, as the commuter trains start to fill once more and the mug cupboard gets its first proper action since early 2020, what are the rules of this new office life? How do I survive all these meetings? At least when I was Zooming I could pretend the wifi had gone down. When it comes to meetings, we should be having less of them, argues Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the Alliance Manchester Business School, and co-author of Remote Workplace Culture. If you have them, have them quick and have them late. Instead of having it at 9 oclock where it can go on until 12, have it at 11.30, because everyone gets hungry at 12.30. Three-hour meetings are useless. Reach your goddamn decision and dont have game-playing. You can also set an alarm on your phone to go off 10 minutes into one of those scheduled informal chats that can fill the soul with dread. Once your phone starts vibrating, you can claim its an urgent call to do something - anything - else. And if someone corners you when youre trying to wrap up for the day? If someone was hovering around my desk, Id just explain that I want to go home and see my kids, says Cooper. But Id add that Ill give them a call and talk properly another time. Everyone in my office stinks - perfume, gym, feet, cigarette smoke, aftershave, fruity vape clouds, breath. How do I cope? Should I tell them? Might they not realise? The onion armpits, the stagnant gym bag, the Hoover-bag breath: it is sort of amazing anyone ever sleeps with their colleagues. If youre in a position of responsibility and they are in your team and it was becoming a problem for business - say they were stinking out meeting rooms or clients were saying something - then I think it would be worth saying something, as long as they are your junior, suggests etiquette expert Jo Bryant. I dont think you can start telling your boss they smell - its not going to go well. But how exactly do you tell a colleague that they hum? I think it would be worth saying: Somebody noticed a smell the other day in a meeting, so Im just asking everybody to double-check that jackets and shirts are clean. In other words, make it vague and make it anonymous. Explain that youre just doing a team-wide thing - everybodys checking, because something has been said; you cant say by who. And if its your boss? My primary schoolteacher mum always swore by a dab of tiger balm under your nostrils, Olbas oil on your collar or mentholated chewing gum to block out the stench of other peoples bodies. Or maybe you should invest in a really heavy-duty face mask. Telling your boss they smell is not going to go well. Illustration: Vincent KilbrideThe Guardian The office chair is killing my back. Can I ask for a better one? And how do I stop colleagues from fiddling with the levers while Im away? Alison Green, author of Ask a Manager, points out that you are well within your rights to ask for a better chair if the current one is causing you physical discomfort. Frame it in terms of ergonomics, and ask for an ergonomic assessment, if thats a thing your workplace does. As for stopping colleagues from messing with it, that can be a losing battle. You can always try asking them to stop - but if they need to use that chair when youre not in, they need it to fit them just as much as you need it to fit you. The real problem may be that your office needs more chairs. I miss my spouse, children, dogs etc. Is it OK to Zoom them from the office? Modern etiquette, explains Bryant, is all about causing the least amount of friction. Before the pandemic, we would have gone to a breakout area, waited until lunchtime or gone out of the building for a few minutes to make a phone call; exactly the same rules should apply to video calls. The exception to that rule might be if it was late in the evening, the office was quiet, you were having to work late and you want to say goodnight to the children. But in normal, busy office hours, it should be avoided. Thats no fun. Is it at least OK to walk around the office while Im on the phone? I want to hit my 10,000 steps. If you see people just walking around - as if theyre in their sitting room or walking down the street - thats disturbing for other people, Bryant says. If you were that busy, you wouldnt be wandering around. Its the busy people who are always doing miles around the office, calling it multitasking and telling everyone how busy they are. Theres no need to draw attention to yourself in that way. If your office has hot-desking, how do you reserve your favourite seat (by the spider plant, with the view of the train line, out of view of the colleague who harrumphs whenever you open a packet of crisps) without getting in at 7am? Weve seen firms try to do hot-desking before, and one of the ways people tried to retain a little bit of ownership was almost like a dog cocking their leg - theyd keep it disgusting, says Bruce Daisley, author of The Joy of Work, presenter of the Eat Sleep Work Repeat podcast and former vice-president of Twitter in Europe. I think thats a classic performative bit of status. A low-status person definitely wouldnt dare to leave their space looking dishevelled. Unless your workplace has a formal booking-in system then you have to accept that youre not going to get your favourite desk, mouse, or chair, says Bryant. If youre hybrid working, in a team situation where you know youre doing two or three days and know who youre sharing your desk with, I think you could leave your notebook or pen neatly on the desk. But nobody wants to sit down in front of pictures of your children or novelty pencil sharpener. If youre hot-desk sharing or hybrid sharing with someone senior to you, then clean out every time. Also, dont leave anything around that could be personal or data-sensitive - be sensible about it. Is my professional tracksuit going to cut it at work? It is black and it does have a waistband - but it also has quite a lot of elastic and some fairly indelible porridge marks. A shirt or a suit makes some people feel more comfortable, says Cooper. Personally, I havent worn a suit for a year and a half and in that time Ive written five books. Cooper points towards the fact that the old model of hard shoes and shaved faces didnt seem to make us more productive. If we were so efficient pre-Covid, in the formal environment we had, why was productivity per capita bottom of the G7 and 17th out of the G20? Id say our environments werent relaxed enough. If youre customer-facing and you think your customers or clients want you to be formal, thats one thing. But I think we need to lighten up. What do I do if someone on a nearby desk starts coughing? Is it rude to move seats? Should I offer them a sweet? A lateral flow test? A mask? I think Id ignore it to start with, advises Bryant. If it didnt go away, Id ask if they were feeling OK, hint, hint. If it carried on, at the end of the day I might say: Do you think you ought to stay at home tomorrow because its horrible for you to have to be in such a dry, air-conditioned environment with your cough. Put it as a concern for their comfort, rather than your own, and highlight the fact that, hopefully, many of us are now more able to work from home. As for sniffing, my personal advice would be to follow the lead of my old classmate during our GCSE exams and wear earplugs. Is it ever appropriate to microwave fish in an office kitchen? My first ever office - in Leeds - had a working kitchen with a hob in the basement and I thought nothing of cooking a full stir-fry down there during my lunch break. I even grated the carrots. Another colleague ate tinned mackerel at her desk. To some extent, we forgot that being in an office meant the occasional smell of someone microwaving fish, Daisley points out. Or the challenge of dealing with the person next to you chewing gum all day. The mini-frustrations or hell that other people represent. Were just coming to terms with it again. You could always, if really tortured, put an Out of Order sign on the microwave, turn it off at the plug and go back to your joyless cold sandwich feeling smug. If really tortured by lunchtime smells, put an Out of Order sign on the microwave. Illustration: Vincent KilbrideThe Guardian Can I ask someone whos off sick to join our Zoom call? Its not going to kill them, surely? If theyre off work because theyre sick, its an absolute no, says Bryant. If theyre off work because theyre doing something like childcare, or waiting in for a plumber, then I think the pandemic has opened up the concept that we can log in from anywhere and do our jobs more remotely than we thought. If people arent incapacitated themselves, and are able to join the call from home, then I think thats fine. As long as youre not encroaching on some private emergency or crisis. There are boundaries. What do I do if I need to burp, fart, scratch, yawn or sneeze during a meeting? I cant turn off my mic and camera any more? Bodies are such chaotic, animal things. Even when they are dressed up in a navy polyester blazer and put in a swivel chair. We all need to relearn the techniques we used to use to handle these moments, before going remote, Green advises. Sneezing is generally recognised as uncontrollable; its going to happen. But if you have to burp, fart, or scratch yourself somewhere indelicate, ideally youd briefly excuse yourself from the meeting. Yawning is trickier. It can be just as uncontrollable as sneezing but can give the impression that youre bored or disengaged. Drinking water can help but if you really cant hold it in, try to be discreet about it. You want it to be as subtle and as far away as possible from a loud, back-stretching yawn. I dont wear a mask in the office but one of my colleagues does. Should I mask up when I approach them for a chat? If theres a group of us in a small room, should we all put masks on? There are no longer any real rules about this, which means each organisation must create its own guidelines and each member of staff is responsible for how they act. But what are the medical implications? It very much depends on whether you work with anybody vulnerable, who might be at higher risk, says Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical director of Patient.info. If its a relatively young, relatively healthy, all-vaccinated group of people and there are 10 of you, the chances of anybody being infected at any one time is probably one in five or so, which means theres an 80% chance youd be wearing face masks all day for no reason. Saying that, if you work with people who are older, more vulnerable and particularly if they have suppressed immune systems for any reason, then the risks are not remotely insignificant. You can usually spot if someone in your office is older but whether someone has an underlying health condition can be impossible to judge. I dont think its fair to put the onus on that person to talk to everyone in the team, Jarvis continues, so perhaps have a chat with your line manager. That is, after all, what bosses are for. As for the type of mask you wear, Sarahs answer is wry but pertinent: It does need to have at least two layers. But frankly, a fairly cheap, two-layer cloth mask is a great deal more effective if worn over your nose and mouth than the best FFP mask in the world when its only worn beneath your chin. How do I tell my manager that I want to keep working flexitime? They dont have kids and only have a 15-minute commute, so I just dont think they understand. Ideally, youd point to how well it has been working already, Green suggests. Explain that its been a major boon to your quality of life not to have to spend as much time commuting, and talk about what youve done to ensure it hasnt affected your work. If you havent already been doing it and thus dont have that data to point to, another approach is to ask to do it as a limited-time experiment, such as for six weeks, and then revisit it after that so that your boss has a chance to see that it works. Are tea rounds still allowed or do we all have to do the lonely caffeine walk to the kettle solo, now? I once worked with a woman who remembered whose mug was whose by lining them up along the counter from who she thought was most leftwing to most rightwing, while she boiled the kettle. You could, alternatively, reduce the chances of cross-infection by asking for a washing-up sponge and some detergent. The tea round was a wonderful, very gentle assertion of these mini bonds of connection between us, says Daisley, sounding wistful. In the past few years weve got our work done tactically, and weve maybe detached ourselves from some of the office idiots, but one thing weve definitely done less in the past two years is laughed. The late chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks talked about simcha. Its a Hebrew word that translates as joy, but its also a participle of we. Every time we have meaningful moments, they become part of who we are, they have simcha running through them. In a very small, British way, the tea round had that simcha to it.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/mar\/18\/covid-resurgence-uk-infections-record-older-people-vaccinations","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/mar\/18\/covid-resurgence-uk-infections-record-older-people-vaccinations","DATE":"2022-03-18 17:08:17","PLAIN_TEXT":"A resurgence of Covid cases is under way across the UK, with infections in the over-70s at a record high and school leaders fearing that preparations for A-levels and GCSEs are being disrupted by outbreaks among staff and students. Based on random swab tests taken in the community, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that almost 5% of the population in England, or 1,544,600 people, had Covid in the week ending 12 March, and 3.5% of people in the oldest age group. Infections also reached a record high in Scotland, where one in 14 tested positive. Related: Covid immunity declines steeply in care home residents in England - study The high prevalence among older people has prompted unease, after reports this week that vaccine immunity declines steeply in care-home residents. It is six months since many people in this age group had their last vaccine dose. Older age groups, especially people who have been isolating for so long, are now quite vulnerable even if they have kept up to date with their vaccines, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. The increase in infections is being driven by the more transmissible Omicron BA.2 variant, which has become the dominant strain across the UK. It transmits more readily than the original BA.1 strain but there is good cross-immunity between the two variants. default Its basically sweeping up everyone who didnt get Omicron the first time around, Hunter said. This, he added, meant the current wave was more likely to follow a short, sharp trajectory as seen in Denmark and the Netherlands where there had been an Omicron BA.2 wave. It wouldnt surprise me if it peaks before the end of March, he said. Prof James Naismith, a director at the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, noted the higher prevalence in Scotland than England despite its more stringent rules, including a continued mask mandate in shops and on transport. My main concern is for the vulnerable, for whom this disease is serious and for those whose lives will be blighted by long Covid, he said.. Every effort must be made to triple-vaccinate as many people as possible, quadruple-vaccinate the most vulnerable and make available antivirals. Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the ONS Infection Survey, said: These latest figures show further increases in infections across most of the UK with high levels of infection everywhere, and in Scotland the highest our survey has seen. Its notable also that infections have risen in all age groups, with the over-70s reaching their highest estimate since our survey began. Schools in England have recorded rising numbers of Covid cases and absences as part of an exit wave of Omicron-variant infections. It comes after the ending of most safety measures in schools, including requirements for students to take twice-weekly tests. Attendance data compiled by FFT Datalab shows that pupil absences in England are rising nationally for the first time since January. The south-west, including Cornwall, shows the highest rate of pupil absences, with nearly 10% of secondary school students off midway through March. Tretherras secondary school in Newquay told parents this week that entire year groups would have to stay at home and learn remotely because more than 30 staff members were absent, including 22 with confirmed Covid cases. Parents were told that sixth formers in year 12 were to work from home on Monday, following years 9 and 10 students working remotely this week. Please know that closing a school bubble is a last resort, and we have looked at alternative solutions and year groups, however, due to staffing implications this is not possible, the schools executive headteacher told parents. Richard Lander school in Truro has also had more than 30 staff members off sick, the majority Covid-related, forcing it to tell students in years 8, 9 and 10 to work from home until next week. Headteachers said supply staff remained hard to find, with schools prioritising teaching for students taking A-level, BTec and GCSE exams starting in eight weeks time. We are dealing with unprecedented levels of staff absence due to Covid, and despite our best efforts to ensure that all our students have a specialist, known teacher in front of them - or indeed a supply teacher - we have reached a point where sadly it is not possible, said the head of one school who is organising a rotation of year groups working remotely. Caroline Derbyshire, the chair of the Headteachers Roundtable group and executive head of Saffron Walden County high school in Essex, said her trust has had as many staff off with Covid in the four weeks since self-isolation and testing measures were ended as the previous 12 months. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: At such a critical time, with exam season looming, leaders are now faced with challenges on staffing and in some cases a sudden increase in remote learning.

In the short term, working at home has penalised women, pushing more of them into double-shifting, or out of work. But there may be reasons for optimism in the longer term if conventional career paths break down alongside daily work patterns. The further we get from the assumption that good careers mean full-time and continuous employment, the better for gender equality. Women are still penalised for going part-time or taking time out. They are better qualified than men, and this gap is increasing, but their competences are still under-recognised and undervalued, to everyones detriment. This highlights what Ive called the Paula Principle: that most women work below their level of competence. Because they involve men as well as women, the current upheavals in work patterns could well undermine this principle.Tom SchullerLondon * Every time I read a piece on how people are happier working at home, I despair. Rarely is the plight of people trying to work in homes without adequate space considered. Or the pressure they are likely to be under to accept these working conditions as the new normal when this is all over and businesses decide that the economics of a largely work from home workforce suit them better than a return to office life. Given that many people in Britain live without adequate space to work permanently from home, this is a serious omission. I think of friends whose kitchendining table is now their computer station. Its not feasible to pack everything up at the end of the day. The kitchenliving room is now their office into which they have to squeeze their need to cook. They have eaten on their laps for the past year. No space now to enjoy the pleasures of cooking and sitting round the table with friends. No money to move to a bigger property. Ask them what benefits working from home brings. Answer: pretty much none. For people in this predicament, even working partly from home will have a detrimental effect on their lives. Will the impact on their private lives be taken into account when their employers decide whether their workforce will return to the office? I doubt it.Ruth WindleFrome, Somerset * Your article (Group of junior bankers at Goldman Sachs claim inhumane work conditions, 18 March) reports on high work demands, sleep deprivation and poor mental health among 13 junior bankers at Goldman Sachs. While these concerns are serious, to focus on a small group of the brightest recruits overlooks that such problems have long existed across the entire economy, and among the less privileged. For research published in Cornell Universitys ILR Review, we analysed 52,000 employees representing the working populations of 36 European countries. Yes, white-collar workers average high levels of overtime. But they are not alone in working overtime, and many other workers also report that they must often work under tremendous pressure and uncertainty. Not only are high work demands widespread, our analyses also reveal that the negative implications of work demands for stress and fatigue are similar across industries and occupations. Progress is needed in banking, but our data reveals that poor working conditions exist everywhere. Also, junior bankers arguably have the option to access alternatives in the labour market. For others, unemployment may be the only alternative. So we should avoid focusing narrowly on excesses at the top of the labour market. Instead, employers and policymakers must address the challenges that work demands present across the economy.Dr Argyro Avgoustaki Associate professor of management, ESCP Business School, Dr Hans TW Frankort Reader in strategy, The Business School (formerly Cass)","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/may\/16\/how-to-get-your-home-ready-to-sell-best-price-property","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/may\/16\/how-to-get-your-home-ready-to-sell-best-price-property","DATE":"2022-05-16 06:00:52","PLAIN_TEXT":"Make sure you can move It sounds obvious but it is worth asking yourself why you want to sell your house and whether you will achieve what you want from the sale. Simon Shinerock, the chair of Choices Estate Agency, says it is worth checking out the area you want to move to and speaking to a mortgage broker to make sure you can get the finance for your next purchase. Think about your linked purchase - will it dovetail [with your move]? Are you willing to move into rented accommodation if it doesnt? Shinerock says. These are all things that could determine how you feel about an offer from a buyer later. Create a good first impression As soon as you have decided to sell, you should work on making sure your home looks as presentable as possible - even before you invite an estate agent in. Were all people, and if Im going round and looking at a place and working out how easy it will be to sell and how much it will go for, then my perception of your property will affect that, Shinerock says. I wouldnt invite anyone round to my house without first attending to it. You can create a good impression even before someone goes through your front door. Photograph: Faiz BalabilAlamy He says people will buy what they see - would-be buyers want to be shown a property they can mentally move into straight away. A tidy appearance to the front of your home doesnt just include tidying up the garden or weeding the pathway, says Sanel Konyar, an interior designer who runs Interior Kollection. It also applies to your front door and any accessories you add surrounding this first point of contact with potential buyers. Repainting a tired-looking front door is a good start, as is mending a broken gate - anything that looks in need of fixing could be noted by a potential buyer as a hassle or expense they could do without. If your outdoor mat looks like it has seen better days, remove and replace. This is an easy and cheap way to improve a buyers first glance yet is so often overlooked, Konyar says. If your front door features glass panels or a porch with glass before your front door, ensure that the hallway is clutter-free and boots and shoes are tidied away. Get valuations Talk to local estate agents and see if they will give you a quote for what the property is worth and their commission. A good place to start when picking an agent is recommendations from friends who have moved recently. See which companies have lots of boards (saying sold as well as for sale). You can use property websites such as Zoopla and Rightmove to get an insight into which agents are successfully selling homes near you - tick sold in your search to see these. Make contact and arrange to get an appraisal of your home. Talk to local estate agents for an initial quote for what the house is worth and their commission. Photograph: RexScott Aiken Choose an agent Once you have spoken to several estate agents you need to choose which one to go with. Compare their commission, sales success, valuation and where they advertise. You might choose the one you liked best - having a good rapport is important - or your decision might be based on the price or their recent success rate. If you like one agent but have been offered a better commission or shorter contract by another firm, dont be afraid to ask your favoured person if they can match it. Agents are often willing to negotiate - especially when there are more buyers around than there are homes on the market. Clear outstanding issues When you get an offer, your buyers solicitor will ask for all kinds of paperwork - you can prevent any hold-ups later by making sure you can put your hands on it now. Alex Lyle of the estate agency Antony Roberts says theres a long list of things you should try to get ready, including proof of ID, as well as documents linked to any work you have had done on your property. Building regulations approval, planning permissions, Fensa certificates for replacement windows and doors, and a safety certificate for any new boiler are among the paperwork you will need to show - so pull them together now. Doing so gives you the chance to check there are no outstanding issues that need sorting out. Dealing with any issues regarding your home before anyone goes through the front door prevents any delays later. Photograph: Katarzyna BialasiewiczAlamy Get your team in place Lyle says: Too often, properties go under offer and then theres an unnecessary delay in anything further happening. Usually, this is due to the vendor having not instructed a solicitor, or the solicitor has been instructed but doesnt have the necessary information to provide to the buyers solicitor. Clare Andrews, a residential property partner at the law firm Moore Barlow, says there are practical advantages to acting early. In a competitive market, appointing a solicitor as soon as you can, not only sends a clear message out to potential buyers that youre ready to proceed without delay, but gives your solicitor time to review the title deeds and iron out anything that could cause a problem in the transaction. There is no harm in researching and choosing a solicitor to do your conveyancing before your property is on the market. Again, recommendations from friends are the best start. Otherwise, you can use the Law Society website to find a property specialist and check out reviews for the ones nearby. Decide on a price You will probably have an idea of what you want to raise from the sale - maybe based on what you have seen other properties go for in your neighbourhood. Shinerock says this may be useful if you live on a road where there are lots of generic properties changing hands regularly but if your home is at all different from those of your neighbours, you could be misled. Think about what the agents have suggested but bear in mind that some work on high turnover Think about what the agents have suggested but bear in mind that some work on high turnover, so will underprice to sell fast - but that wont get you top dollar. Starting too high is a danger as being forced to reduce the price on your property can give potential buyers the impression that something is wrong with your home. Lyle says you should not get carried away when deciding what to ask for: Its better to come on to the market slightly lower, attract more interest, and let people bid each other up to your desired price feeling like theyve really won it. Keep things neat ... Keep inside as clutter-free as you can for the agents photos and viewings. Samantha Agbontaen, the founder of Housedesigner.net, says sellers should avoid having too much furniture and drastically reducing free space available for walking. Your house will feel bigger if people can move around without having to squeeze past your belongings, so it could be worth putting some things in storage. If you have a loft or watertight shed you can stash things there. If not, it may be worth paying for storage for a few weeks to maximise the price you get for your home. Is your home free of clutter? Photograph: Justin LambertGetty Images ... but not too neat If your home is too minimalist, this can make it feel clinical and uninviting to potential buyers, Konyar says. She suggests using throws, cushions and rugs to make sure it feels like a home. Think about who might buy your house and whether your decor will appeal to them. If you are planning to repaint any rooms, go for neutral colours and use accessories to add a bit of character.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/may\/30\/home-working-drives-demand-shoffice-space-uk-gardens-shed-office","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/may\/30\/home-working-drives-demand-shoffice-space-uk-gardens-shed-office","DATE":"2021-05-30 14:34:14","PLAIN_TEXT":"Cropping up at the bottom of gardens up and down the UK is the latest trend among the countrys home workers - the shoffice, an office in a shed. After more than a year working from kitchen tables, sofas or spare bedrooms, many Britons are looking to carve out a quiet workspace in the loft or in their garden. Jules Carluccio, who works in local government, is one of the millions of workers who has not been back to her usual workplace since last spring. In anticipation of permanent home working she decided to splash out on a shoffice. The new workspace in her Bedfordshire garden is much more than a humble garden shed. At more than 8 sq metres, the wood, metal and glass structure comes complete with a canopied seating area and mains electricity. It did not come cheap at PS17,500. It was a big [financial] commitment, but I weighed it up, Carluccio said. I looked at how long I would be staying at the property, how long I would be in my job, and also the kinds of uses I wanted from it. Office sheds are growing in popularity, as staff expect to spend more days at home. Photograph: Cherry BeesleyHandout More than a third (38%) of UK workers worked from home in mid-May, accordingto data from the Office for National Statistics. Few office-based staff expect to go back to their desk for five days a week. Earlier this month, the accountancy firm EY became the latest company to tell employees they will be expected to work from home for at least two days a week, even after coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Its 17,000 staff will move to a hybrid working model, combining home working with the office, as well as client visits. Many other large office occupiers plan to adopt hybrid working, to cut office costs as much as pleasing staff. These staff need somewhere to work on the days when they are not required to be at their desk. The booming demand for home offices pushed the company Smart Garden Rooms, Offices &amp; Studios to its best-ever month in April, when it notched up PS750,000 of sales, more than double its monthly average. Since reopening last May, the Suffolk-based firm has scarcely been able to build its garden offices quickly enough to keep up with demand, despite taking on a third more staff. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Its managing director, Matt Moss, said: People dont spend PS20,000 on a garden room on a whim, thinking I might be able to work from home going forward. People are committed to this. Our level of enquiries amazes us every single day; that it is so consistent, he said, adding that shoffices usually do not require planning permission. The trend is being repeated elsewhere. Sales of garden buildings rocketed by 500% between January and May, compared with a year earlier, while sales of sheds soared by more than 460%, according to the DIY and building supplies retailer Toolstation. Workers desire to create an office away from the office is also inspiring some to move upstairs. On Englands south coast, the Brighton Loft Company has had an 80% increase in inquiries during the pandemic, which its owner, Gilles Buxton, ascribes to demand for home offices.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"environment\/2022\/aug\/13\/toki-the-orca-captivity-miami-seaquarium","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2022\/aug\/13\/toki-the-orca-captivity-miami-seaquarium","DATE":"2022-08-13 10:00:39","PLAIN_TEXT":"Five decades ago, a group of men rounded up more than 80 orcas in a cove on Whidbey Island off Washington state. Using boats, explosives, nets and sticks, they separated young orca calves from their mothers. Locals were haunted by the whales human-like cries, according to an account of the day. Six baby whales were taken away that day in Penn Cove and sold to marine parks. Most didnt last a year in captivity. Only one who was captured and sold is still alive. The Miami Seaquarium acquired Tokitae, who performs under the name Lolita, the only whale captured in Penn Cove in 1970 who is still alive. Photograph: Jeff GreenbergUniversal Images GroupGetty Images That female whale has spent the past 52 years of her life in a pool in the Miami Seaquarium - the smallest orca enclosure in North America - performing for crowds until her retirement earlier this year. Now theres a chance she could finally go home. Activists are fighting to return the whale - named Tokitae - to the Pacific north-west to live out her final days and possibly reconnect with her family. Her mother, believed to be in her 90s, still swims the waters of the Salish Sea, leading a pod of southern resident killer whales to find salmon. Her captivity is an anachronism - a bridge between a time when whales were sold for human entertainment, and today, when the practice is largely scorned. The campaign to release her has gathered supporters from around the globe, and united activists, Indigenous groups and philanthropists with a common cause. We owe all these captive animals an opportunity to live in an environment as close to their natural environment as we can possibly provide, says Charles Vinick, of the Whale Sanctuary Project, which helps free captive whales around the world. Activists have called for the release of Tokitae to possibly reconnect with her pod and live out her final days in the Salish Sea. Photograph: Cristobal HerreraEPA Whales like Toki have earned their human owners millions of dollars and entertained countless people, Vinick reminds. We owe them a retirement program, a pension ... giving them back something like this is the least we can do. But her possible release also poses profound questions about how to repair the damage of past mistakes. Can an animal who has spent so long in captivity be safely released into their native environment? If not, where should she go? The answers could point the way forward for her other whales around the world. The Whale Sanctuary Project notes that there are still more than 3,000 whales and dolphins in captivity globally, including 60 orcas and more than 300 belugas at marine parks and aquariums. Its against all odds that shes still alive Tokitae, whose show business name is Lolita, performed in shows for 48 years of her life, jumping, flipping and hoisting trainers in the air. Life hasnt always been easy: for a decade, she shared a tank with another killer whale named Hugo, but he died of a brain aneurysm in 1980 after repeatedly slamming himself into the glass walls of the enclosure. Toki is the second oldest killer whale in captivity and is in remarkably good shape. Here, she is seen performing with a trainer in 1995. Photograph: Nuri VallbonaAP Tokitae, Toki for short, is the second oldest killer whale in captivity, and her health has had its ups and downs. For instance, recent independent assessments chronicled the aftermath of an acute illness that sickened her earlier this year. But despite such issues, experts say she has remained in remarkably good shape considering her long captivity. Howard Garrett is a whale researcher and activist with the Orca Network on Whidbey Island, who started working on plans for her release back in 1995. Shes a miracle every day, says Garrett. Its against all odds that she is still alive. I think its about her mental health that keeps her physical health in good shape. He points to videos showing that Toki exercises herself with no trainers present, doing laps and racing around the pool. Shes not withdrawn, neurotic, not the stereotypic behavior that indicates any kind of brain damage associated with being in captivity, he says. She may be a complete outlier in her ability to stay healthy. Efforts to free Toki have stretched for decades, but have taken on renewed urgency in recent years. Campaigners got a boost in 2005 when southern resident orcas were granted protection under the Endangered Species Act - protection that was extended specifically to Toki in 2015 by the National Marine Fisheries Service. In 2021, the USDA released a report outlining how the Miami Seaquarium had cut corners and had denied Toki adequate care - including dirty water in her tank, a lack of shelter from the beating sun, and feeding her rotten fish which led to intestinal issues. Protesters attempt to turn people away from the Miami Seaquarium in 2015, the same year that Toki was given protection under the Endangered Species Act. Photograph: Wilfredo LeeAP And in 2021, the Seaquarium was sold to a new owner, more amenable to discussions about releasing Toki, and a philanthropist named Pritam Singh started a foundation - Friends of Lolita - to work on her eventual release. Vinicks organization is now working on Tokis situation alongside Friends of Lolita and Tokis owners, The Dolphin Company (which is the company licensed to operate the Seaquarium). Garrett believes returning her to the Pacific is possible; she could still be transported for 10 hours in a comfortable fleece-lined stretcher from Miami to somewhere in the San Juan Islands with cool water, and he says there has never been any harm done to whales while moving them in 50 years. If successful, her release would be a rare case. Few other whales have made it out of captivity. Keiko - who portrayed Willy in the Free Willy movies - was rehabilitated in a sea pen in Oregon in the 1990s before moving to Iceland and living five more years in the wild. But he was just 22 when he was moved from captivity, a far cry from Tokis age. Indigenous communities, especially the Lummi Nation of Washington State, have also gotten involved. In 2019, the Lummi gave her the name SkaliChelh-tenaut, which means that she is a member of SkaliChelh, the resident family of orcas who call the Salish Sea home. The Lummi Nation joined in the fight to free Toki. Douglas James, a Lummi member seen here in 2018, leads protesters in song. Photograph: Miami HeraldTribune News ServiceGetty Images We consider the southern resident killer whales to be our relatives that live under the waves, says Raynell Morris, a Lummi member who is on the board of the nonprofit Friends of Lolita and a part of Sacred Lands Conservancy. From the beginning of time we have loved and respected them. Morris says that Tokis story connects to Indigenous people and their own history of displacement: Its the connection to how our Indian children were taken away to boarding schools without permission and they were stripped of language, culture and family. And many of those children never returned home. We need to take care of her and bring her home. No simple solution Tokis future is still unclear - there is an operational plan drafted to bring her back to the Salish Sea, but she would need a lot of space and potentially food for the rest of her life. She could end up at a netted enclosure run by the Whale Sanctuary Project, a 100-acre (40 hectares) area in Nova Scotia where they hope to bring others, based on the model for land-based sanctuaries for big cats, elephants and great apes. Another question is one of health - not just hers but that of others, if she were to encounter her pod. Experts worry that the infections Toki picked up in captivity could be spread to other southern resident killer whales, an already-endangered group that numbers only 74 individuals. And of course, with her age, some fear she might not survive the journey. And if she did, there are concerns about the stress of a new, wild environment on an elderly whale. Toki seems to still remember her family from before she was captured in 1970. Photograph: Wallie V FunkWestern Washington University These are very difficult, ethical and health issues, he says. Ethically? Oh, yeah, take her home. But at the risk of her life, thats a much more difficult question. Vinick, however, points to her long survival in one of the smallest tanks in the world. She is one tough whale, says Vinick. And she seems to still remember her past life with her family - in 1996, a researcher recorded Tokis family greeting one another around the San Juan Islands, and reporters played the recording to her at the Miami Seaquarium. She appeared to recognize the calls, though its not clear if she could still communicate with her kin. Tokis situation is unprecedented with no clear answers, but her advocates wont give up trying to find them. How do you evaluate those risks with an endangered species? Do you take any risks? And do you take risks for her life? Vinick asks. Those are the issues we are dealing with I think for the first time ever in her life.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2021\/jul\/06\/working-from-home-uk-inequality-housing-income","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2021\/jul\/06\/working-from-home-uk-inequality-housing-income","DATE":"2021-07-06 07:00:21","PLAIN_TEXT":"The latest voice to sing the praises of working from home is the Climate Change Committee. It is pushing at an open door: with a commitment to flexible working in the Conservative manifesto, and Labour pushing the government to bring forward new laws, it is all but certain that the number of people going to work in offices every day will be lower after the pandemic than it was before. The number of workers to whom such changes apply must not be overstated. Official figures report only about 26% of people working from home (WFH) in 2020. Geographical and sectoral variations are huge: fewer than 14% of people in Middlesbrough worked from home compared with more than 70% in Richmond upon Thames. In Scotland, 70% of people employed in communications worked remotely, but just 7% in the accommodation and food industries, perhaps not surprisingly. It is easy to see why working remotely is viewed as an attractive prospect. Most of us like being in our own place, surrounded by our own things. By contrast, work is widely associated with stress and difficulty, at least some of the time. The TUC strongly supports more flexibility, not only with regard to location but also hours (making it an option for more people). Cutting down on commuting, which is necessary to reduce carbon emissions, would also bring benefits to those saved from the expense and discomfort of rush hours. For some groups the gains are plain to see. The rise in online activity has meant the past year has offered opportunities to disabled people that were previously off limits. For those struggling with housing costs, including younger adults in the south-east where rents are highest, the switch to remote working offers the possibility of living somewhere cheaper while keeping the same job. For families with children, flexibility has long been highly prized for making care easier. Related: Idea of commuting fills me with dread: workers on returning to the office It will take time to assess how such changes stack up against the downsides of shrinking workplaces. These include the risk that a hybrid model, whereby people divide their time between home and work, will turn out to penalise those who are on the video call rather than in the room when decisions are taken. Judging from pandemic trends, which saw women take up the bulk of additional domestic tasks, including home schooling, it appears likely that the losers in this situation would be women. There are questions too about the transmission of knowledge, and whether younger employees stand to lose out on opportunities of mentorship and learning. How important is it to organisations that their people share the same space, eat together and so on? How do we quantify the informal effects of people physically working alongside each other - making and losing friends, falling in love? What about the 7.9 million people in the UK who live alone? That there is no one-size-fits-all should be no surprise: there are about 30 million workers on a payroll in the UK, plus 4.35 million self-employed people. But if the future of work in the UK seems certain to involve more WFH for some groups, it follows that inequalities in housing are as relevant to the discussion as those between jobs and earnings. The contrast between the recent experiences of those with a home office or spare room and those joining meetings from their bedrooms has been widely noted. Like enforced home schooling, WFH means different things to different people. Digital access and energy costs as well as physical space must be factored into any policy. But there is also a danger that deeper divisions are reinforced by a shift that turns millions more flats and houses into workplaces. The bottom rungs of the so-called property ladder have already been hiked way beyond the reach of a growing number of people trapped in privately rented accommodation. A policy that further cements the importance of property ownership - because people are working in homes as well as living in them - could easily turn out to boost the interests of owner-occupiers and landlords at the expense of the UKs estimated 13 million private renters, who are already at a disadvantage due to their lack of assets and housing security. Proof of widening housing and wealth inequality caused by the pandemic already exists. Price inflation over the past year was driven by owners using savings to get hold of more space, as well as the chancellors decision to give buyers a stamp duty holiday (PS180bn is estimated to have been added to household savings, with home workers in better paid and professional jobs the least likely to have been laid off or furloughed). Prices of detached homes rose 10% - twice as much as flats - with rural areas seeing the highest rises. Some evidence suggests that lower housing costs in cities could be the beneficial result for renters. A new help-to-buy scheme and mortgage guarantees are meant to help the less well off. But researchers have warned of increasing polarisation between neighbourhoods. Thats because, while businesses providing services such as food and hairdressing in areas with higher concentrations of home workers can expect to flourish, equivalent businesses in places where mostly poorer people still go to work will suffer along with city centres. The peak of amateur property development as a cultural phenomenon may have passed. The TV shows became repetitive and boring. But already there are hints that WFH is driving a new wave of home improvements. Building garden offices or retro-fitting may improve peoples lives, or even contribute to the common good by reducing emissions. Related: Revealed: rise in stress among those working from home But it is disingenuous to talk about WFH without acknowledging the extent to which homeowners economic interests are tied up with property. At a time when asset ownership (not just property but pensions and other investments) is radically changing understandings of class, as Christine Berry and others have argued, homes are where owners cash is, as well as their hearts. That doesnt mean that owner-occupiers like me think about property prices when we wake up in the morning. But if more homes are to become workplaces, it is more urgent than ever to address the current grossly unequal distribution of housing (recent research suggests the UK now has 2.7m buy-to-let landlords). Wealth is not the only dividing line in our society. Just 3.9% of deaths result in inheritance tax (up to PS325,000 is exempt); passing more wealth than that down the generations remains the preserve of a small minority. The UK is one of the most income-unequal countries in the western world and the rise of zero-hours contracts, coupled with benefit cuts, means that for many people housing and income insecurity go together. Black, minority ethnic and female workers are disproportionately affected. There is no telling yet what long-term effect working from home might have on incomes. But while there are undoubted upsides, the property market data so far does not suggest the overall impact will be progressive. Rather, they point to the likelihood of further asset inflation and a worsening of the UKs already chronic property addiction. More secure and longer tenancies, and a huge increase in the supply of social housing, were desperately needed before; the signs are that ever greater numbers working from home will only intensify that need.

The trials are still under way. Nir Grinberg, an assistant professor at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, said the kind of commoditisation of disinformation that was being exposed by the Story killers project was relatively novel. The biggest impact of such campaigns, he said, could be that they created a facade of effectiveness that is larger than life, which in turn made individuals question the authenticity of everything they saw. Unless civil society redraws the rules for these online spaces, steps in to defend them, and holds communication platforms accountable, we are looking at a future where anyone can be the target of such disinformation campaigns, Grinberg said. Female journalists around the world, in particular, have become targets. Ressas publication, Rappler, exposed the work of troll armies that manipulated information around Rodrigo Dutertes 2016 presidency. Her breakthrough journalism has made her the target of vicious online attacks and prosecution. In January, Ressa, who is widely considered the face of the free press in the Philippines, was acquitted of tax evasion charges, in a case she has described as part of a pattern of harassment. Interactive Jessikka Aro, a Finnish journalist from Yle, Finlands national public broadcaster, was targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign after she began investigating and reporting on Russias Internet Research Agency, a state-controlled troll farm that spreads online propaganda and influence operations. Among the attacks Aro faced were smear emails and messages sent to colleagues and politicians, and attacks on Twitter. In one instance, Aro received a text message from someone claiming to be her deceased father, who said he was observing [her]. Journalists have paid a particularly high price for the global disinformation crisis. One in four journalists killed in non-conflict zones between 2017 and 2022 were targeted by disinformation campaigns, according to a Forbidden Stories analysis of data compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/may\/16\/private-children-home-bosses-iengland-criticised-huge-profits","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/may\/16\/private-children-home-bosses-iengland-criticised-huge-profits","DATE":"2022-05-16 13:04:15","PLAIN_TEXT":"Childrens home providers in England should not be able to profit from caring for societys most vulnerable children, the new head of the Association of Directors of Childrens Services (ADCS) has said. Steve Crocker criticised private providers driving around in sports cars and buying racehorses with their profits after getting rich off taxpayers money. Profit margins for the 15 largest private childrens home operators average 22.6%, according to the Competition and Markets Authority. Most councils in England have at least one looked-after child whose private placement costs PS10,000 a week or more, with costs running to PS60,000 a week in the most extreme cases. Yet in Scotland, which has moved much closer towards a not-for-profit childrens care system, costs are generally lower. There should be a national approach to management and profits, said Crocker, calling for a national cap on fees in England. We have long had the aspiration to make the sector not-for-profit - Scotland, which has had that aspiration for longer, has got nearer to it. The wealth of some at the top of some childrens care companies can be conspicuous. Blaklion, a horse that raced in the Grand National last month, is owned by a former childrens home chain boss and property developer, Darren Yates. He bought the animal in 2019 for PS300,000 after selling his Sandcastle Care chain to a private equity firm. The business became part of Aspris, which said the acquisition would result in it having annual revenues of more than PS200m. Earlier this year the Guardian exposed Robert McGuinness, the owner of a squalid childrens home in Bolton, who drove around in a Lamborghini and spent large amounts of company money running a bar in York and on his own social life. The childrens home was shut down. A solicitor for McGuinnesss company said at the time that the expenses were legitimate. Asked if the profits mattered if the homes were good, Crocker said: It does matter because the profits that theyre making and what theyre getting rich off is taxpayers money. We should expect good value for money for public expenditure. Crocker, a former residential care worker and social worker who is in charge of childrens services at Hampshire council, said some providers were making large profits by cherrypicking the easiest children, with some maintaining their good Ofsted ratings by refusing to take children with the most complex needs. He added: One of the ways in which providers can ensure that they have a good or outstanding rating is that they basically get the pick of the children. In any one day they might get referrals for 10 children and they will choose, perhaps understandably, the children that are likely to be less challenging. The ones that havent got substance misuse problems, the ones that arent gang affiliated, who havent got significant convictions for violence etc etc. The result, he added, was a two-tier system where there was a severe shortage of homes for really tricky kids. Many local authorities who sold off their childrens homes in the past 30 years amid a series of abuse scandals were now trying to buy or build new ones to save money in the long-term, said Crocker. Many of these homes were just for one child - because often we find that when we put them with other children the problems really multiply. Despite some government funding available to build homes, councils still struggled after 11 years of austerity cuts and the ever increasing cost of crisis placements, he said. Childrens services departments were spending most of their budgets on a small number of children in care, said Crocker. As a result they cannot afford to expand the early intervention work that stops problems escalating. Captionalt text: Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter - every weekday morning at 7am BST We would really want to invest much more heavily in early health and prevention and family services. Thats got to be the way forward, he said, adding that the ADCS really really hopes such measures are in the forthcoming independent review of childrens social care. He also wants to see childrens homes jointly funded by child and adolescent mental health (CAMHS) services to offer therapeutic work to deal with behaviour problems Crocker said the current system usually managed to keep children safe but did not do enough to heal damaged children. Generally speaking, the English child protection system is one of the safer in the world, he said. But I think Id argue that although it might be safer, Im not sure we do enough yet to heal trauma of children. A Department for Education spokesperson said: All children and young people deserve to grow up in a stable, loving home, and no private company should exploit those in need of placement. We commissioned an independent review of childrens social care, which will recommend reforms to the system, and are working hard to raise standards for children in care while it continues.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/live\/2021\/nov\/17\/coronavirus-news-live-pfizer-to-license-covid-pill-for-poor-nations-beijing-tightens-entry-rules-ahead-of-olympics","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/live\/2021\/nov\/17\/coronavirus-news-live-pfizer-to-license-covid-pill-for-poor-nations-beijing-tightens-entry-rules-ahead-of-olympics","DATE":"2021-11-18 00:23:53","PLAIN_TEXT":" 12.23am GMT Thats it from me, Samantha Lock, for todays blog. Please follow along with all our coronavirus coverage here. Also feel free to send tips or suggestions to me at samantha.lock@theguardian.com or via Twitter @Samantha__Lock Ill be back with you shortly. 12.18am GMT Summary Heres a quick summary of the latest headlines: The US is set to boost vaccine manufacturing and produce at least a billion doses a year. The Biden administration is planning to dedicate billions of dollars to build up vaccine manufacturing in the US to produce at least a billion doses each year, in an effort to shore up global Covid-19 supply for poorer countries while also pre-empting future pandemics. Europe is the only region with increasing Covid deaths, the World Health Organization reports. Covid deaths rose 5% in the last week as deaths in all regions other than Europe remained stable or declined, and totalled 50,000 worldwide last week. Of the 3.3 million new infections reported, 2.1 million came from Europe. Sweden is introducing a digital Covid-19 vaccination certificate for public gatherings and events with more than 100 people indoors, authorities said Wednesday. Spain has approved the use of a Covid-19 booster shot for people between 60-69 years old and for health workers, as part of an effort to combat an uptick in infections. The Czech Republic and Slovakia both reported record daily new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a day before the two European Union countries plan to approve new restrictions for unvaccinated people in response to rising infections. A fourth Covid wave is hitting Germany with full force, Merkel says. Germany reported 52,826 new infections on Wednesday - up by a third from a week ago and another daily record, while 294 people died, Belgium tightened its coronavirus restrictions, mandating wider use of masks in indoor settings and enforcing work from home, as cases rose in the countrys fourth Covid wave. The country has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the EU. The UK reported another 38,263 Covid infections and a further 201 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mandatory vaccine passports are set to be introduced in Northern Ireland. Covid deaths have decreased 17% in the Americas over the past week, but the most populous countries like the US, Brazil and Colombia are seeing a levelling of new infections after weeks of declining trends, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. Hungary reported 10,265 new Covid-19 infections, its highest daily tally since the end of March. 11.31pm GMT A Florida man has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for collecting nearly $1m in Covid-19 relief funds after submitting more than 100 fraudulent applications for himself and others, AAP reports. Leonel Rivero, 35, was sentenced in Miami federal court, according to court records. He previously pleaded guilty to wire fraud. He was also ordered to pay over $1m in restitution. Rivero owned a tax-preparation business and submitted approximately 118 fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications on behalf of himself and his accomplices, according to the criminal complaint. Those loan applications sought a total of more than $2.3 million, and Rivero and his accomplices received approximately $975,582, investigators said. 11.21pm GMT Its Samantha Lock back with you and taking over from my colleague Tom Ambrose. As usual, a quick rundown of where Australia stands with Covid before I begin. The state of NSW has recorded 262 new Covid-19 cases and 3 deaths over the latest reporting period. Victorias daily case numbers have jumped back over the 1,000 mark, with 1,007 new infections recorded in the state. Sadly, 12 people infected with the virus have died. Australia is also hoping a tourism campaign lures travellers from Singapore when two-way quarantine-free travel resumes between the two countries, AAP reports. From Sunday, fully vaccinated Singaporeans can arrive in Australia without quarantining as long as they return a negative Covid-19 test. 10.34pm GMT Brazil registered 11,977 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, the countrys health ministry confirmed today. It also recorded a further 373 Covid deaths in the last 24 hours.

Photograph: Anadolu AgencyGetty Images 10.18pm GMT Wales first minister has said there will be no changes to the nations Covid rules this week. Mark Drakeford confirmed on Wednesday that restrictions would remain the same and the country would stay on alert level 0. He thanked residents for helping to reduce record-high coronavirus case rates over the last three weeks. But he warned of a fourth wave sweeping across Europe, and said extending the Covid Pass across the hospitality sector in future weeks remains an option should cases again soar. Mark Drakeford, first minister of Wales, who has said there will be no changes to the nations Covid rules this week. Photograph: Gareth FullerPA The case rate in Wales has fallen to 507.4 per 100,000 people, and is no longer the highest in the UK, having dipped slightly below Northern Ireland where the case rate is 509.2. Drakeford said: Three weeks ago we were facing a very serious situation in Wales but everyone has pulled together and cases have fallen back from those record high levels. I want to thank everyone for their hard work and the steps they have taken to protect themselves and their loved ones. Saying yes to the vaccine and crucially to the booster remains an essential step to help keep Wales safe, he added. As we start to plan for Christmas we need to keep on working together to bring coronavirus under control. The pandemic hasnt gone away - a fourth wave is sweeping across Europe, with many countries introducing stricter restrictions once again. We will do everything we can to keep Wales open and to keep Wales safe. This means keeping the option of extending the use of the Covid Pass if cases rise again and pandemic pressures on the NHS increase, to help keep the hospitality sector open and trading through the busy festive period. Updated at 10.42pm GMT 9.58pm GMT In the United States, the White House says about 10% of eligible children aged 5 to 11 have received a dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine since its approval for their age group two weeks ago. At least 2.6 million kids have received a shot, White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said on Wednesday, with 1.7 million doses administered in the last week alone, roughly double the pace of the first week after approval. The Associated Press reported: Its more than three times faster than the rate adults were vaccinated at the start of the nations vaccination campaign 11 months ago. Zients said there are now 30,000 locations across for kids to get a shot, up from 20,000 last week, and that the administration expects the pace of pediatric shots to pick up in the coming days. Kids who get their first vaccine dose by the end of this week will be fully vaccinated by Christmas, assuming they get their second shot three weeks after the first one. 8.45pm GMT The Biden administration is planning to dedicate billions of dollars to build up vaccine manufacturing in the US to produce at least a billion doses each year, in an effort to shore up global Covid-19 supply for poorer countries while also pre-empting future pandemics. As part of a public-private partnership, the government will draw on knowledge from companies that already use mRNA technology to make vaccines. Its ambitious goal is to get to a point where the US can produce at least a billion doses each year starting around mid-2022, according to the New York Times, which first reported the news. This is about assuring expanded capacity against Covid variants and also preparing for the next pandemic, David Kessler, who leads vaccine distribution for the White House, told the Times. The goal, in the case of a future pandemic, a future virus, is to have vaccine capability within six to nine months of identification of that pandemic pathogen, and to have enough vaccines for all Americans. Related: US to boost vaccine manufacturing and produce at least a billion doses a year 8.29pm GMT Sajid Javids criticisms fuelling abuse of doctors, says GPs chief Sajid Javids criticisms of how GPs work have fuelled a rise in verbal and physical attacks on them and their staff, the leader of Britains family doctors has claimed. Dr Richard Vautrey said comments by the health secretary and NHS bosses, alongside negative coverage of GPs in some newspapers, had wrongly made the public think they were hiding away from patients, and exposed staff to abuse. Vautrey, the outgoing chair of the British Medical Associations GPs committee, made the claim in an interview with the Guardian before the unions decision on Thursday about whether to press ahead with industrial action in protest at a government edict that GPs in England must see any patient face to face if requested. Before the pandemic 80% of consultations in England were face-to-face. That fell dramatically on government and NHS orders when the Covid pandemic struck, though in recent months it has risen again to 60%. Related: Sajid Javids criticisms fuelling abuse of doctors, says GPs chief 8.13pm GMT Good evening, Im Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest Covid news from home and abroad over the next couple of hours. We start with the news that the Czech Republic and Slovakia both reported record daily new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a day before the two European Union countries plan to approve new restrictions for unvaccinated people in response to rising infections. Thousands in the capitals of both countries, Prague and Bratislava, used Wednesdays anniversary of the 1989 anti-communist Velvet Revolution to rally against their governments upcoming coronavirus restrictions. The protesters ignored social distancing and didnt wear masks. Police didnt intervene in Prague. In Bratislava, police said two officers sustained injuries after the crowd near the seat of the government detonated fire crackers.

Photograph: Anadolu AgencyGetty Images The Czech daily tally soared to 22,479 new cases, eclipsing the previous record set 7 January by almost 5,000 and nearly 8,000 more than just a week ago. The countrys infection rate rose to 813 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, up from 558 a week earlier. 7.02pm GMT Thats it from me for today. Thank you all so much for reading along, writing in and generally keeping me company. My colleague Tom Ambrose will be along shortly to continue our coronavirus coverage, and Ill see you all again tomorrow. 7.00pm GMT Fourth Covid wave hitting Germany with full force, Merkel says Germanys coronavirus situation is dramatic, the chancellor Angela Merkel has said, calling for an extra push on vaccinations ahead of a crisis meeting with federal and regional leaders to agree on measures to curb a fourth wave of the virus. Germany reported 52,826 new infections on Wednesday - up by a third from a week ago and another daily record, while 294 people died, bringing the total to 98,274, as the pandemic tightens its grip on Europe. The surge in infections comes at an awkward time in Germany with the conservative Merkel acting in a caretaker capacity while three other parties negotiate to form a new government after an inconclusive September election. Merkel said a national effort was needed and appealed to federal and regional leaders meeting on Thursday to introduce steps to trigger tighter restrictions based on the number of infected people being hospitalised in a week. A draft of the document to be discussed and seen by Reuters sets out steps, including forcing people to show proof of vaccination or recovery or a negative Covid test on public transport and at work and imposing tighter restrictions for leisure activities. In addition, financial aid for companies and individuals hit by the crisis could be extended by three months to the end of March 2022. Merkel appealed to vaccine-sceptics to change their minds and called for a speedier distribution of booster shots. Merkel told a congress of German city mayors: The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force. The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening. It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination. If enough people get vaccinated that is the way out of the pandemic. Only 68% of people in Europes most populous country are fully vaccinated - lower than the average in western Europe due to a tradition of vaccine hesitancy, while 5% of the population has had a booster shot. The Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats, who aim to form the next government, will also propose measures to fight the pandemic in a draft law to go to parliament on Thursday. That would replace emergency powers, due to end on 25 November, which provide a national legal framework for restrictions. Merkels conservatives want to extend these powers instead. 6.45pm GMT Summary Here is a quick recap of some of the main developments from today so far: Belgium tightened its coronavirus restrictions, mandating wider use of masks in indoor settings such as cafes and restaurants, and enforcing work from home, as cases rose in the countrys fourth Covid wave. The country has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the EU, at around one per hundred people over the past 14 days, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The prime minister Alexander De Croo said: The alarm signals are all red. Spain is now offering third doses of Covid vaccines to people aged 60 and over, expanding the booster shot programme from the previous age threshold of 70 as infections rise, the prime minister Pedro Sanchez said. The UK Health Security Agency said children aged between 12 and 15 should delay getting a Covid vaccine if theyve recently had Covid to at least 12 weeks after they were infected. The advice brings guidance for 12 to 15-year-olds into line with that for 16 and 17-year-olds, who were advised to wait 12 weeks after infection before getting a shot when officials gave a go ahead for second doses for that age group. The UKHSA said that the increase in the gap, from previous guidance of a 4-week interval, could cut rare cases of a mild and usually short-lived side effect of heart inflammation known as myocarditis further. The UK reported another 38,263 Covid infections and a further 201 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the governments coronavirus dashboard. Mandatory vaccine passports are set to be introduced in Northern Ireland after Stormont ministers voted by a majority to support the move. It is understood that, amid rising infections and increasing pressure on the healthcare system, the health minister Robin Swann wants to see enforceable Covid certification in operation across a range of hospitality settings from 13 December. Sweden plans to introduce a requirement for Covid vaccine passes at indoor events where more than 100 people attend, a step recommended by health officials warning of a rising tide of infections in coming weeks. The spread is increasing in Europe. We havent seen it yet in Sweden, but we are not isolated, the health minister Lena Hallengren said. We need to be able to use vaccination certificates. Also in Sweden, the Public Health Agency said it would reverse a widely-criticised decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show symptoms of Covid-19. Covid testing in Sweden has fallen by some 35% after the health agency announced in October that people displaying symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they were fully vaccinated against the virus. The recommendation drew heavy criticism at a time when the pandemic is gaining traction again across Europe. Hungarian doctors have warned of a very sad Christmas ahead and called for preventive measures as infections and hospitalisations continue to rise. Hungary reported 10,265 new Covid cases on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since the end of March, prompting the countrys Medical Chamber to call for a ban on mass events and mandatory mask-wearing in closed spaces. In a statement, the Hungarian Medical Chamber also said entry to restaurants, theatres and cinemas should be conditional on a Covid immunity certificate. The World Health Organization said coronavirus deaths in Europe rose by 5% in the last week, making it the only region in the world where Covid-19 mortality increased. In its weekly report on the pandemic, the WHO said Covid deaths in all regions other than Europe remained stable or declined, and totalled 50,000 worldwide last week. Of the 3.3 million new infections reported, 2.1 million came from Europe. It was the seventh consecutive week that Covid cases continued to mount across the 61 countries the WHO counts in its European region. The Czech Republic will ban people who have not been vaccinated against Covid from access to public events and services from Monday, the prime minister Andrej Babis announced, and negative tests will no longer be recognised as qualification to enter events and service establishments. The restrictions, to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday, come after a surge in new infections to a record 22,479 on Tuesday. People have to finally believe that Covid kills, Babis said. 6.30pm GMT Belgium mandates indoor mask-wearing and working from home Belgium tightened its coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, mandating wider use of masks and enforcing work from home, as cases rose in the countrys fourth Covid wave, Reuters reports. From Saturday, all people in indoor venues such as cafes and restaurants will need to wear a mask unless seated and the rule will apply to those aged 10 or older. The previous age threshold was 12. Nightclubs may have to test their guests if they want to let them dance mask-free. People wanting to eat in a restaurant or go to the theatre already must present a Covid pass, showing vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery. Most Belgians will also have to work from home four days a week until mid-December, and for three days after that. Belgium has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the European Union, at around one per hundred people over the past 14 days, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The alarm signals are all red, the prime minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. We had all hoped to have a winter without coronavirus, but Belgium is not an island. The new restrictions are still milder than the lockdown imposed on the unvaccinated in Austria and the shortening of bar and restaurant opening hours in the Netherlands. De Croo said Belgium planned to give booster jabs, currently limited mostly to the elderly, to the wider population. Belgiums infections rise has been sharpest in the northern region Flanders, where vaccination rates are higher, prompting eased restrictions in October. Updated at 6.33pm GMT 5.59pm GMT Spain is now offering third doses of Covid vaccines to people aged 60 and over, expanding the booster shot programme from the previous age threshold of 70 as infections rise, the prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday. Spain has fully vaccinated 79% of its population, and started the campaign to administer booster shots last month, including for cancer patients, nursing home residents and other vulnerable groups. The meeting of the vaccines panel has just ended, and it has been agreed that a third dose of vaccination will be given to health and social-health professionals and for people over 60 years of age, Sanchez told reporters during a visit to Turkey. The countrys infection rate, as measured over the preceding 14 days, has been rising steadily since late October. It rose to 96 per 100,000 on Wednesday from about 89 on Tuesday, though remains well below levels in some countries like Austria, with over 1,400 cases per 100,000, or the Netherlands with over 900. Spain reported 6,667 cases on Wednesday, bringing the total to 5,067,712 since the pandemic began, while the number of deaths rose by 30 to an overall 87,775. 5.40pm GMT The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said that children aged between 12 and 15 should delay getting a Covid vaccine if theyve recently had Covid to at least 12 weeks after they were infected, Reuters reports. The advice brings guidance for 12 to 15-year-olds into line with that for 16 and 17-year-olds, who were advised to wait 12 weeks after infection before getting a shot when officials gave a go ahead for second doses for that age group. Currently, 12 to 15-year-olds are only advised to get an initial shot of Pfizers vaccine, which has been associated with rare, mild and usually short-lived side effect of heart inflammation known as myocarditis. The UKHSA said that the increase in the gap, from previous guidance of a 4-week interval, could cut rare cases of myocarditis further. The Covid-19 vaccines are very safe. Based on a highly precautionary approach, we are advising a longer interval between Covid infection and vaccination for those aged under 18, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at UKHSA, said in a statement. This increase is based on the latest reports from the UK and other countries, which may suggest that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination will further reduce the already very small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups, she added. Children have had some of the highest rates of infection in England since schools went back at the start of September, although prevalence has fallen from its peak since a half-term school holiday at the end of October. UKHSA said that current advice for at-risk children between 12-17 was unchanged, owing to their higher risk from Covid which would outweigh any benefit from delaying the shots. 5.04pm GMT Canada is set to announce it will no longer require travellers returning from short foreign trips to take PCR Covid tests, a government source has said. Reuters reported that the source, who requested not to be named, said the change will affect those taking trips of 72 hours or less. The travel industry complains that the requirement to take the tests, the most reliable commonly-used method of detecting Covid, is deterring tourism. The official announcement is expected to be made on Friday. 4.50pm GMT Covid deaths have decreased 17% in the Americas over the past week, but the most populous countries like the US, Brazil and Colombia are seeing a levelling of new infections after weeks of declining trends, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. Mexico is reporting an increase in new deaths and in the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago had a sharp rise in deaths as intensive care unit (ICU) beds fill with patients with Covid, PAHO said. In an important milestone, half of the people in Latin America and the Caribbean have now been fully vaccinated against Covid, though coverage remains below 10% in Nicaragua and Haiti, PAHO director Carissa Etienne said. The Covid pandemic is still very active in our region, she warned in a webcast news conference. Countries across Central and South America have seen a decline in new infections, except for Bolivia, it said. As Uruguay and Chile have relaxed pandemic restrictions, Covid cases have risen, even with their high vaccination coverage, the health agency said. Etienne urged people in the region to get vaccinated and stick to social distancing and mask wearing as the holiday season approaches. 4.22pm GMT The UK has reported another 38,263 Covid infections and a further 201 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the governments coronavirus dashboard. That compares with 37,243 cases and 214 fatalities reported in the 24 hours prior. Updated at 4.38pm GMT 4.17pm GMT Ministers vote to introduce vaccine passports in Northern Ireland Mandatory vaccine passports are set to be introduced in Northern Ireland after Stormont ministers voted by a majority to support the move. The PA news agency understands DUP ministers opposed the health minister Robin Swanns proposal at the executive meeting on Wednesday. However, the other four executive parties - Sinn Fein, SDLP, Alliance and Mr Swanns UUP - backed the move. Swann wants to see enforceable Covid certification in operation across a range of hospitality settings from SS3 December. While the four DUP ministers voted against the proposal, the party did not deploy a cross-community voting mechanism that could have blocked the introduction of vaccine certification in the region. The Department of Health is set to produce a further paper detailing how the policy will be rolled out. PA Media understands Swann has proposed that passports are used to gain entry to nightclubs, hospitality premises that serve food andor drink, cinemas, theatres and conferences halls. Covid certificates would also be needed to access indoor events with 500 or more attendees where some or all of the audience is not normally seated. They would be required for outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees where some or all of the audience is not normally seated. They would also be mandatory at all events of 10,000 or more attendees whether the audience is seated or not. Swann is proposing that regulations needed for the law change come into effect on 29 November, with a 14-day grace period prior to becoming enforceable on 13 December. Under the proposals, people wishing to gain entry to the venues would need to demonstrate evidence of Covid-19 vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result, or proof of a coronavirus infection within the previous six months. A modelling paper from health officials presented to the Executive ahead of Wednesdays meeting warned passports may not be enough to suppress rapidly increasing Covid case numbers, which have surged 23% in a week, and that more severe restrictions may need to be considered in mid-December to avoid hospitals being overwhelmed. Swanns proposals come amid escalating pressures on the regions beleaguered health system. Covid-19 transmission rates have soared in recent weeks, particularly among young people. Making certification a legal entry requirement for hospitality venues has been credited with driving up vaccination rates among young people in the Irish Republic. Proof of vaccination has already been required to access cinemas, nightclubs, theatres, concert halls and large events in Wales. Scotland has similar requirements, though the government is considering whether to expand it to other sectors. In England, the government ditched its plans for vaccine passports for access to nightclubs and large events, which had been due to start at the end of September. However, they could still be introduced under its so-called winter plan B if the situation deteriorates. Updated at 5.12pm GMT 3.36pm GMT Dutch health authorities said on Wednesday they were running short of Covid tests, as the Netherlands registered more than 20,000 new cases for the second day in a row, the highest since the pandemic began, Reuters reports. We are coming up against the maximum of our capacity, Jaap Eikelboom, head of Covid-19 operations at the National Public Health Service, said in a statement. The service said it was working to expand test capacity amid a new surge that has caught health authorities and the prime minister Mark Ruttes government off guard. About 85% of the adult Dutch population is fully vaccinated. The National Institute for Health (RIVM) on Tuesday reported a record of more than 110,000 new cases in the week ended 16 November, an increase of 44% from the week before, with the strongest rise among children aged 4-12. Hospital admissions are rising and several are curtailing regular care to accommodate patients with coronavirus. The latest wave began shortly after the government ended social distancing and other measures in September - a decision that has been reversed as cases surge. Earlier this month, Ruttes government reintroduced masks in stores, and last weekend it reimposed a partial lockdown, including closing bars and restaurants after 8pm. But the impact of those measures has not yet been seen in the daily numbers. Parliament met with Rutte on Tuesday night to debate whether to restrict access to indoor public venues to people who have a corona pass showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. Politicians were sharply divided on the idea, with some arguing that it discriminates unfairly against the unvaccinated and others arguing that it may be necessary anyway as a matter of public health. No law has yet been proposed for a vote. Updated at 3.52pm GMT 3.14pm GMT Sweden to introduce Covid vaccine passes for indoor events The Swedish government plans to introduce a requirement for Covid vaccine passes at indoor events where more than 100 people attend, a step recommended by health officials warning of a rising tide of infections in coming weeks, Reuters reports. Infection rates have soared across large swaths of Europe in recent weeks and while Sweden - hard hit at times earlier in the pandemic - has yet to record a similar surge, healthy agency modelling suggests infections will reach a peak in mid-December. The centre-left government was preparing a bill to be put forward to parliament with the aim to having the vaccination passes in effect from 1 December, the health minister Lena Hallengren said. The spread is increasing in Europe. We havent seen it yet in Sweden, but we are not isolated, she told a news conference. We need to be able to use vaccination certificates. Swedens health agency said earlier on Wednesday it would reverse a widely criticised decision to stop recommending testing for people who were fully vaccinated but show symptoms of Covid. [see 12.16pm.] Around 85% of all Swedes over 16 have received one dose vaccine and 82% have had two doses or more. Sweden currently has the lowest number of patients with Covid in hospital and in intensive care in the European Union, relative to the size of the population, according to OurWorldinData, but has been hit hard by earlier waves. Sweden has opted against lockdowns and relied mostly on voluntary measures aimed at social distancing. It has seen several times higher deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours but lower than most European countries that opted for strict lockdowns. Several aspects of Swedens handling of the pandemic, such as poor testing, have been strongly criticised by a government-appointed Covid commission. 3.00pm GMT As Covid cases in the US begin to rise once more and health agencies consider booster shots for all adults, some states and cities are taking matters into their own hands and urging additional shots, advice that goes beyond current federal guidelines. Leaders in Colorado, California, New Mexico, Arkansas, West Virginia, and New York City recommend that residents older than 18 seek an additional shot six months after their initial immunisation. These states and cities have little in common, except their health systems have been stretched to a breaking point before during the pandemic - and one-third or more of their population is still unvaccinated.

The country reported 10,265 new Covid cases on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since the end of March, prompting the countrys Medical Chamber to call for a ban on mass events and mandatory mask-wearing in closed spaces. In a statement, the Hungarian Medical Chamber also said entry to restaurants, theatres and cinemas should be conditional on a Covid immunity certificate. We must slow down the increase in the number of patients, a flooding of hospitals [with patients with Covid] or many families will have a very sad Christmas, they said. Apart from a slowing vaccination campaign, we have not seen any preventive measures [to contain the pandemic]. The daily tally is getting close to the peak of 11,265 reached during the third wave of the pandemic in a country with hardly any restrictions in place and where the vaccination rate is below the European Union average. A new wave of infections has swept across central Europe with hospitals struggling to cope in some countries such as neighbouring Romania. Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland have all tightened rules on mask-wearing and introduced measures to curb infections. In Hungary, the government of the prime minister Viktor Orban, who is facing a close election in early 2022, has urged people to take up vaccines and announced mandatory inoculations at state institutions. It also empowered private companies to make vaccinations mandatory for employees. But it has refrained from making mask wearing mandatory in closed spaces - apart from on public transport and in hospitals - and there are no other restrictions in place. On Tuesday, the government said it was monitoring cases, and if necessary will take further measures. The government has not replied to emailed Reuters questions. The country of 10 million has reported 32,514 deaths from Covid since the start of the pandemic but only 5.78 million of its people are fully vaccinated. More than 1.66 million people have received a booster shot. Updated at 2.47pm GMT 2.22pm GMT The European Unions drug regulator said on Wednesday it could issue an opinion on Novavaxs Covid-19 vaccine within weeks if the data it has received so far is sufficient to show the shots effectiveness and safety, Reuters reports. The vaccine, called Nuvaxovid or NVX-CoV2373, has been under a rolling review since February making the speedy timeline for potential approval possible, the European Medicines Agency said. If approved, the shot would be the regions fifth coronavirus vaccine, joining those from PfizerBioNTech , Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The major approval could come ahead of authorisation in the United States, where Novavax had to resolve manufacturing issues and expects to file for approval by the end of the year. The EMA said two of its advisory panels were looking into various plans submitted by Novavax on risk management, and development and studies of the vaccine for use in children. Novavaxs shot received its first emergency use approval earlier this month in Indonesia. The company has also sought backing from the World Health Organization. The Philippines on Wednesday authorised emergency use of a version made by Indias Serum Institute. Updated at 3.11pm GMT 1.40pm GMT The World Health Organization said coronavirus deaths in Europe rose by 5% in the last week, making it the only region in the world where Covid-19 mortality increased, AP reports. The UN health agency said confirmed cases jumped 6% jump globally, driven by increases in the Americas, Europe and Asia. In its weekly report on the pandemic issued late on Tuesday, the WHO said Covid deaths in all regions other than Europe remained stable or declined, and totalled 50,000 worldwide last week. Of the 3.3 million new infections reported, 2.1 million came from Europe. It was the seventh consecutive week that Covid cases continued to mount across the 61 countries the WHO counts in its European region, which stretches through Russia to central Asia. While about 60% of people in western Europe are fully immunised against Covid, only about half as many are vaccinated in the eastern part of the continent, where officials are struggling to overcome widespread vaccine hesitancy. The WHO said infections have been falling in Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia since July. Within Europe, the highest numbers of new cases were in Russia, Germany and the UK, the WHO said. It noted that deaths jumped by 67% in Norway and by 38% in Slovakia. The health agency previously described Europe as being the epicentre of the ongoing pandemic and warned that there could be 500,000 more deaths by January if urgent actions arent taken. In the last week, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries reintroduced some lockdown measures to try to slow infections, while the UK decided to roll out booster doses to everyone over the age of 40. Updated at 2.45pm GMT 1.25pm GMT The number of Covid-related deaths in Scotland has continued to fall from a recent peak in late summer, with 115 deaths recorded during the week ending Sunday 14 November, 25 fewer than the previous week. National Records of Scotland, the government records agency, said that brought the total number of deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate up to 11,933. The latest surge in fatalities by that measure peaked at 167 in early September, as Scotland experienced a significant surge in Covid infections. NRS said its assessment of deaths among different ethnic groups showed Scots of Pakistani origin were 3.7 times more likely to die of Covid, relative to the population as a whole, Chinese-origin Scots 1.7 times more likely to die. White British residents not of Scottish origin were 0.8 times less likely to die. Some studies show people of Asian heritage are genetically far more susceptible to the Delta variant than other ethnic groups, but poverty and other health issues, including a higher proportion of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, could also be a factor within Scotland. Updated at 1.36pm GMT 1.19pm GMT A year after he left hospital, Ray Connolly is still getting over the Covid that almost killed him. But, he writes, Im not going to waste another minute of my life. Here are some extracts: I was in a wheelchair when they brought me home at the end of September 2020. I had been in intensive care for 102 days. For the first two months my wife, Plum, had not been allowed to visit, instead receiving daily reports on my condition - recurrent delirium, two heart attacks, stents, kidney dialysis, pneumonia, memory loss and tracheotomy - all brought on by Covid. Three times she was told I wouldnt be resuscitated if I suffered any further deterioration and she had come to dread the ringing of the phone. But only when I got home did I fully realise how much she and the families of other Covid patients had suffered. Until I was ill, all I liked to do was to work; writing was my hobby as much as my job. There was always another project. Now I realise that Ive travelled in the US and France far more than in the UK. Theres so much here to do, so much architecture and country to be admired, so much gardening to enjoy, so many books to read and so many family and friends to see. Ive been given a second chance. Im not going to waste it.

The restrictions, to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday, come after a surge in new infections to a record 22,479 on Tuesday. Many European countries, including Czech neighbours Germany, Austria and Slovakia, have recorded rises in infections and have started tightening curbs on unvaccinated people. Slovakia reported a record number of cases on Wednesday, and Hungary and Poland had the highest numbers in more than six months. From that time [Monday] only vaccinations and having recovered from Covid will be recognised when it comes to services and public events, Babis said, adding: People have to finally believe that Covid kills. The Czech Republic, with a population of 10.7 million, has observed relatively light restrictions in the latest Covid wave, with the government pledging no school closures or lockdowns. The government has resisted tightening rules while in transition to a new administration, but the worsening situation in hospitals has made it consider restrictions on unvaccinated people. Hospitals reported 4,425 patients with coronavirus on Tuesday, fewer than half the record highs seen in March, and 661 people in intensive care, the Health Ministry said. The country has recorded a total of 31,709 Covid deaths, with the daily count mostly over 60 in the past days. Its vaccination rate has lagged those of other countries, with 57.6% of the population fully vaccinated versus an EU average of 64.9%, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Updated at 3.00pm GMT 12.47pm GMT The US is planning to invest billions of dollars in expanding Covid vaccine manufacturing capacity to have at least a billion doses by the second half of next year, the New York Times reports, citing top White House advisers. The announcement, to be made on Wednesday, comes as the Biden administration faces pressure from activists to increase the vaccine supply to poorer countries. The investment in vaccine production is part of a private-public partnership to address vaccine needs at home and around the world and also to prepare for future pandemics, Dr David Kessler, who oversees vaccine distribution, and Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, told the Times. The plan is estimated to cost several billion dollars and will be paid for with funds from the American Rescue Plan Biden signed into law in March, Kessler told the paper. This is about assuring expanded capacity against Covid variants and also preparing for the next pandemic, Kessler added. The goal, in the case of a future pandemic, a future virus, is to have vaccine capability within six to nine months of identification of that pandemic pathogen, and to have enough vaccines for all Americans, he said. Updated at 1.57pm GMT 12.16pm GMT Swedens Public Health Agency said it would reverse a widely-criticised decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show symptoms of Covid-19, Reuters reports. Covid testing in Sweden has fallen by some 35% after the health agency announced in October that people displaying symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they were fully vaccinated against the virus. The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the regions offer testing to everyone who is 6 years and older who gets symptoms that may be Covid-19, it said in a statement. The recommendation not to test people who were vaccinated but showed symptoms drew heavy criticism at a time when the pandemic is gaining traction again across Europe. 11.51am GMT Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, has written for the Guardian about how Seoul has probably the best Covid response in the world. At the start of the pandemic, South Korea pursued a zero-Covid policy. How this could affect the wests response to the next pandemic? Here is an extract: South Korea has attracted a lot of attention for following a specific east Asian playbook of maximum suppression: I wrote about this in March 2020, pushing countries to follow the Seoul model, and again in May 2020, laying out the key components of the strategy. This involved finding Covid cases through mass testing, tracing contacts, and supporting isolation to ensure chains of transmission were broken. This was supported by strict travel restrictions to prevent new cases being imported, and strong messaging to the public about wearing masks in public spaces, and the dangers of a new infectious disease. The government worked to protect its people (not to enrich its own interests) and the response was pre-emptive, organised like clockwork, and efficiently delivered. South Korea had experienced Mers, another coronavirus, and understood the dangers of a hands-off approach. As a short-term strategy, maximum suppression helped buy time for scientists to get to work, and therefore find a sustainable exit from the crisis. In 2020, it allowed numerous vaccines to be developed and approved, followed in 2021 by several promising therapeutics that keep people out of hospital and safer from descending into severe disease. Once these new tools became available, the medium- to longer-term strategy evolved, too. The next step after zero Covid has been a focus on vaccinating the population to a high threshold, and acquiring antivirals that can be given in outpatient care to keep the burden off healthcare services. The pivot from maximum suppression to mass vaccination was a rational and logical shift to achieve a successful transition out of the pandemic. The countries that followed this model - South Korea, Taiwan, and even their Pacific neighbours, Australia and New Zealand - are now managing to vaccinate their populations and protect both lives and livelihoods. Each person that wasnt infected in 2020, thanks to these maximum suppression strategies, could live on into the phase we are now in: where vaccines and therapeutics are allowing people who catch Covid to survive, when they might otherwise have died.

As the government scrambles to respond to a dramatic rise in infections over the past two weeks, some of the traditional markets have already been cancelled while others are still waiting nervously for decisions. The Striezelmarkt in Dresden, the oldest Christmas market in Germany, which draws about 3 million visitors annually, is due to open on 22 November. Stallholders have already built their wooden huts and are busy hanging decorations and assembling wooden figures. But they might have to take it all down again at any moment. I cant describe what we are going through at the moment, Karin Hantsche, who has been selling traditional gingerbread at the market for 32 years, told AFP. We are not sleeping at night, we are so nervous and tense. The state of Saxony has said the markets can go ahead, but local authorities in Dresden are due to meet on 25 November and could take a different view. Two still-closed booths during the set-up at the Dresdner Striezelmarkt Christmas market in Dresden, eastern Germany. Photograph: Jens SchlueterAFPGetty Images The central government and the leaders of Germanys 16 states are also due to meet this week to discuss new national measures. With the countrys seven-day incidence rate striking a new record high for the 10th day in a row on Wednesday, they are expected to agree new restrictions such as limiting large gatherings to those who have been vaccinated or recovered from the disease. But these rules would be impossible to implement at the Striezelmarkt, which has no perimeter fence or entrance controls. For Hantsche, whose company brings in 50% of its income over the Christmas period, the closure of the market would be a disaster. Not everyone will survive this, and for me I cant say yet, she said. We are prepared to immediately lay everyone off again if the pandemic situation requires it. But we need some form of compensation for costs, and at the moment we do not have that. Christmas markets have been an annual fixture in Germany since the 15th century, when craftsmen and bakers were given special permission to ply their wares in town squares in the run-up to Christmas. In pre-pandemic times, the markets drew about 160 million visitors annually and brought in revenues of EUR3-5bn, according to the BSM stallkeepers industry association.

As the government scrambles to respond to a dramatic rise in infections over the past two weeks, some of the traditional markets have already been cancelled while others are still waiting nervously for decisions. Photograph: Jens SchlueterAFPGetty Images Most German cities cancelled their Christmas markets last year as Covid-19 cases began spiralling, despite the financial losses. Munich on Tuesday became the first major German city to cancel its 2021 Christmas market, with several smaller markets already cancelled across Germany. Others are still planning to go ahead, but with restrictions: in Leipzig there will be no alcohol, while in Nuremberg, the market will be pared down and split across several locations. Markus Harich, who has been selling traditional festive mulled wine and other drinks at the Striezelmarkt for 30 years, is busy putting the finishing touches to his wooden hut. We are in a very difficult situation at the moment, he said. We dont know what will happen next. Will we open at all? Will the regulations be changed? He too has had sleepless nights worrying about the future of his business. The goods are ordered, but nobody is giving us any information ... At the moment we have really been left alone in a vacuum. Ulrich Poetschke, who sells traditional artwork from Germanys Erzgebirge region, spends most of the year preparing for the festive season because the most important business for us is the Christmas business. We are hearing different news every day about whether the market is taking place, so it is a very, very difficult situation for the traders, he said. The Striezelmarkt in Dresden, the oldest Christmas market in Germany, which draws about 3 million visitors annually, is due to open on 22 November.

Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.comTwitter: @lucy_campbell_ 11.01am GMT Today so far Seoul has reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases, as a recent surge centred on the capital of South Korea strains medical services a fortnight after the country eased social distancing rules as part of its living with Covid project. Hungary reported 10,265 new Covid-19 infections today, its highest daily tally since the end of March. The country has had limited restrictions in place and the countrys vaccine take-up is below the EU average at 60%. The Czech Republic reported 22,479 new coronavirus cases, the highest tally recorded in the country of 10.7 million since the pandemic started. The country is celebrating the 17 November anniversary of the Velvet Revolution. Germanys disease control agency reported 52,826 new coronavirus cases today, as infection rates continue to climb. The seven-day average is at 41,052 cases, the highest it has been during the pandemic. Acting health minister Jens Spahn has called on doctors not to be too strict about waiting at least six months before giving patients vaccine booster shots. Covid infections in Austria have hit a new daily record, with daily infections rising to 14,416. It is the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. On Monday, the country introduced lockdown regulations targeted specifically at the unvaccinated. A health department paper in Northern Ireland has warned that adherence to Covid guidelines by the public is declining and that there has been very low uptake of Covid certification on a voluntary basis by the hospitality sector. The paper goes on to say that without a significant decline in community transmission in the next three weeks there is a risk that more severe restrictions will need to be considered from mid-December to avoid hospital capacity from being overwhelmed. Latest polling suggests that the public in Switzerland will continue back the Covid laws that the government introduced in March in a referendum being held on 28 November. Broadcaster SRG suggests the law will be confirmed with 61% backing it, 38% opposed and 1% undecided. Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, has told the Commons transport select committee that the UKs testing requirements for international arrivals have suppressed demand and caused great confusion. Delivery and logistics firm FedEx has announced it is closing its operations base in Hong Kong over the citys quarantine requirements. Strict new Covid-19 restrictions come into force for visitors to Beijing. All visitors to the capital must now show a negative Covid test result from the past 48 hours, while flights from higher risk areas within China will be cancelled or limited to one a day at reduced capacity In Greece, the ERT news network is carrying an announcement that prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to make a televised address about the pandemic tomorrow. The US has signed contracts worth roughly $1bn to secure the antibody-based Covid-19 treatment Sotrovimab from GSK and Vir Biotechnology. The pharmaceutical companies, while announcing the deal, said supply was expected by 17 December. Aucklanders will be allowed to leave the city this summer after months in lockdown, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has announced, but public health experts warn it could lead to a torrent of Covid-19 spreading into other parts of the country. Thats it from me, Martin Belam, for today. I will be back with you tomorrow. Lucy Campbell will be here shortly. Updated at 11.40am GMT 10.35am GMT New daily Covid cases in Austria pass 14,000 for first time; Salzburg running out of ICU beds Coronavirus infections in Austria have hit a new daily record. Daily infections rose to 14,416 on Wednesday, official data showed. It is the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. The peak of the biggest wave of infections before this was 9,586 about a year ago, when the country went into full lockdown. On Monday, the country instituted a lockdown for those not fully vaccinated, aimed at halting the surge. Roughly 65% of Austrias population is fully vaccinated against the virus. Reuters report that the situation is worst in two of Austrias nine provinces, Upper Austria and Salzburg, where hospitals are coming under increasing strain. Salzburg has said it is preparing for a triage situation when the number of people needing intensive care beds exceeds supply, though that stage has not yet been reached. Updated at 11.40am GMT 10.21am GMT PA Media is carrying quotes from Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association. He has told the Commons transport select committee that the UKs testing requirements for international arrivals have suppressed demand and caused great confusion. He said: I think the restrictions were excessive for too long a period and continue to discourage people principally because of the cost of testing - even though its been reduced now where an antigen test is required rather than a PCR test. Theres no justification for the continued use of these tests based on the data. He added: The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures. Where we see restrictions relaxed or removed, theres an immediate response in terms of passenger demand, and thats been witnessed right across the world. Updated at 10.24am GMT 10.03am GMT Germany registers 52,826 new Covid cases Germanys disease control agency reported 52,826 new coronavirus cases today, as infection rates continue to climb. The seven-day average is now at 41,052 cases, the highest it has been during the pandemic. Reuters report that the Robert Koch Institute said 294 more people died in Germany of Covid-19 since the previous day, bringing the countrys pandemic official death toll to 98,274. Acting health minister Jens Spahn has called on doctors not to be too strict about waiting at least six months before giving patients vaccine booster shots. This chart from yesterdays Robert Koch Institute bulletin gives an idea of the regions most affected in Germany, although authorities may take some encouragement from the fact that a few of the lines on the chart look as if they may be beginning to dip.

It is anticipated that he will call on Greek citizens to keep getting vaccinated, and take booster jabs, and will also call for greater caution in the next few weeks in order to avoid having to put in extra measures before Christmas. Earlier this week, many hospitality venues owners in Greece remained closed in protest against anti-Covid measures and seeking greater financial assistance from the government.

He has said that the Covid-19 pandemic has increased Germanys economic dependency on China in many areas. We have experienced and had to experience how dependent we have become on China, Spahn said at an economic conference organised by the Suddeutsche Zeitung daily, pointing to rising imports of face masks and medical precursors from China. This alone would be worth discussing on an economic summit on its own, the question of how we can at least become a bit less dependent on China again in the 2020s, Reuters note Spahn added. Updated at 9.33am GMT 8.24am GMT Hungary reports highest daily caseload since March with over 10,000 new infections Hungary reported 10,265 new Covid-19 infections today, its highest daily tally since the end of March, the government said on its official coronavirus website. Reuters note that the daily tally is getting close to the peak of 11,265 reached during the third wave of the pandemic in a country that has hardly any restrictions in place, and where the vaccination rate is below the European Union average. This map gives an indication of caseload rates across Europe, where several countries are seeing their highest level of infection, or close to the highest level, since the pandemic began. default Updated at 8.32am GMT 8.11am GMT FedEx to close operations in Hong Kong over strict quarantine rules Agence France-Presse is reporting that delivery and logistics firm FedEx have announced it is closing its operations base in Hong Kong over the citys quarantine requirements. As the global business environment continues to evolve and with the pandemic requirements in Hong Kong, FedEx has made the decision to close its Hong Kong crew base and relocate its pilots, FedEx said in a statement to Hong Kongs public broadcaster RTHK. A company memo written by system chief pilot Robin Sebasco said The decision to close the Hong Kong base reflects this constant evolution and is designed to provide a measure of stability to these team members, as there is no clear timeline when life may return to normal in Hong Kong. FedEx says it will continue to serve Hong Kong with pilots based in Oakland, California. Hong Kong requires the majority of visitors to quarantine for 14 or 21 days after arrival. Earlier this week, Cathay Pacific told its air crew that when returning to Hong Kong they should avoid unnecessary social contact for 21 days after arrival, and isolate at home for the first three days. The rules do not apply to everyone. Updated at 8.33am GMT 8.01am GMT A quick snap from Reuters here, that the US has signed contracts worth roughly $1bn to secure the antibody-based Covid-19 treatment Sotrovimab from GSK and Vir Biotechnology. The pharmaceutical companies, while announcing the deal, said supply was expected by 17 December. Britains GSK said the deal brought the total number of doses secured of the treatment, branded Xevudy, to more than 750,000 globally, adding that the US would have an option to buy additional doses through March 2022. Updated at 8.34am GMT 7.55am GMT Seoul reports record daily case count amid recent surge in South Korea Seoul has reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases, as a recent surge centred on the South Korean capital strains medical services a fortnight after the country eased social distancing rules as part of its living with Covid project. Seoul recorded 1,436 new infections on Wednesday, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. At 3,187, the nationwide caseload came close to the record of 3,270 set in late September. While South Korea has experienced relatively few cases and deaths since the start of the pandemic, 21 deaths were reported on Wednesday, the 16th day in a row of double-digit fatalities that included a record 32 on Saturday, the agency said. The number of critically ill Covid-19 patients is at an all-time high of 522, it added. With 76.1% of greater Seouls ICU beds for Covid patients occupied, the government is facing criticism that it eased restrictions too soon - including allowing larger social gatherings and longer indoor dining hours - in an attempt to revive the pandemic-hit economy. Medical workers have been stretched thin as serious cases have risen at a fast pace. It is safe to say that beds for critical cases are fully occupied, Jeong Hye-min, a professor at Seoul National University hospital, was quoted as saying by the Yonhap news agency.Evidence that serious cases and deaths are rising among older people who were vaccinated early this year has prompted officials to speed up booster shots for people who received their second dose more than six months ago. The gap between the second and third jabs will be reduced from six months to four months for people in their 60s or older, as well as for care home residents and those receiving long-term hospital care. People in their 50s will be eligible for booster shots after five months. South Korea has reported 402,775 cases and 3,158 deaths since the start of the pandemic. A dramatic fall in infections meanwhile is continuing in neighbouring Japan, a trend many experts attribute to its high rate of vaccination - with more than three-quarters of the 125 million population fully jabbed - and widespread mask-wearing. Japan reported 154 cases on Tuesday, compared with more than 25,000 in mid-August. There were 15 in Tokyo - half the capitals daily total a week ago. Updated at 8.36am GMT 7.30am GMT Switzerland is having a referendum later this month on whether the public backs the governments anti-Covid measures. They had been approved earlier in the year, but those opposing the measures have forced a second vote, which will take place on 28 November. Reuters reports a poll this morning from broadcaster SRG that suggests the law will be confirmed with 61% backing it, with 38% opposed and 1% undecided. The law was originally passed in March and expanded financial aid to people hit by Covid and laid the foundation for certificates the government requires for people to enter bars and restaurants and attend certain events. Updated at 7.46am GMT 7.25am GMT Heres a recap of the situation in Northern Ireland, where PA Media has been reporting overnight that they have seen a paper from the Department of Health which has informed Executive ministers that positive cases have risen by 23% in a week. The paper says hospital admissions have risen by 19% in the last week, while occupancy is up 10%. The conversion rate of cases to hospital admissions has risen above 2% for the first time since early September, and is now estimated at around 2.8%. The paper says an increase in admissions is inevitable in the coming week and will continue to rise beyond that if cases numbers are not reduced. Officials warn that community transmission is at a high level and increasing rapidly. The Health Department experts state that without further intervention as soon as possible, modelling suggests hospital capacity may be exceeded in mid-December, if the current trajectory follows a central pathway. The paper states: Evidence suggests that adherence to guidelines by the public is declining and that there has been very low uptake of Covid certification on a voluntary basis by the hospitality sector. It states the need for immediate measures to increase adherence to current mitigations - such as face mask use and work-from-home guidance. It says those mitigations will be unlikely to bring the reproduction rate below one unless they are accompanied by widespread use of Covid certification across higher risk settings. Robin Swann, Northern Irelands health minister, has previously proposed that mandatory Covid-19 passports become enforceable from 13 December. PA says it understands that Swann is proposing that passports are used to gain entry to nightclubs, hospitality premises that serve food and or drink, cinemas, theatres and conferences halls. The passport issue has sharply divided the five-party coalition in Belfast. PA reports that the paper warns that without a significant decline in community transmission in the next three weeks there is a risk that more severe restrictions will need to be considered from mid-December to avoid hospital capacity from being overwhelmed. Updated at 7.46am GMT 7.12am GMT Czech Republic records highest ever daily Covid caseload of 22,479 17 November is usually a day of great celebration in the Czech Republic, as people remember the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution that ended the communist government in Czechoslovakia. However, the day has started with some worrying news. Reuters report that the Czech Republic reported 22,479 new coronavirus cases for Tuesday, the highest tally recorded in the country of 10.7 million since the pandemic started. The seven-day rolling average of case numbers is at 11,313, as opposed to the level of a week ago, when it stood at 7,878. Updated at 7.47am GMT 7.06am GMT Hello, it is Martin Belam here in London, taking over from Samantha Lock in Sydney. Heres a reminder of the Covid situation in the UK. According to the governments own data dashboard, case numbers are up over 14% on the previous week, but deaths were down 10% and hospitalisations were down 4% on the previous week. default The UK media round is being handled for the government by international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan. Ill bring you any Covid lines that emerge from that, as well as the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. Updated at 7.47am GMT 6.58am GMT Easing of New Zealand Covid rules could lead to summer crisis, experts warn Aucklanders will be allowed to leave the city this summer after months in lockdown, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has announced, but public health experts warn it could lead to a torrent of Covid-19 spreading into other parts of the country. Our reporter in New Zealand, Eva Corlett, has the full story here.

All visitors to the capital must now show a negative Covid test result from the past 48 hours, while flights from higher risk areas within China will be cancelled or limited to one a day at reduced capacity, the AFP reports. The restrictions also reportedly include Covid tests every three days for the more than 30,000 people working with cold-chain imports in the city. Beijing is the capital and has strong regional and international connections ... The virus must not be introduced into Beijing and it must not spread in Beijing, city spokesman Xu Hejian said at a press conference on Tuesday. With less than 100 days to go to the games in February, China is bracing for a challenge to its zero-Covid strategy when thousands of international athletes descend on Beijing after months of strict border controls. No spectators from outside China will be allowed to attend the Olympics, which will be held from 4 February in a closed-loop bubble. And the estimated 2,900 athletes must be fully vaccinated or face 21 days quarantine upon arrival. They will also be tested daily. Updated at 6.47am GMT 6.04am GMT Welcome back to our live Covid news blog this Wednesday. Im Samantha Lock and Ill be with you for the next short while to give you a rundown of all the latest headlines. First up, in a move that may go towards closing the vaccination gap between the worlds wealthiest and poorest nations, US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has announced a deal to make its antiviral Covid-19 pill available more cheaply in the worlds least-wealthy countries. The company will allow generic manufacturers to supply its Paxlovid pill to 95 low-and middle-income nations covering about 53% of the worlds population, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Strict new Covid restrictions will also come into force in Beijing from Wednesday for visitors to the Chinese capital, requiring negative tests and dramatically cutting domestic flights, the AFP reports. With less than 100 days to go to the Winter Olympics in February, China is bracing for a challenge to its zero-Covid strategy when thousands of international athletes descend on Beijing after months of strict border controls. Auckland, New Zealand, is set to lift Covid travel restrictions in December. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases public official in the US, said on Tuesday that if America further ramps up vaccination rates and those already immunised take booster shots that it is feasible Covid-19 could be reduced from a pandemic emergency to endemic status next year. Pfizer has announced it is asking US regulators to authorise its experimental antiviral Covid-19 pill, Paxlovid, which has been shown in clinical trials to cut the risk of hospitalisation and death for adults by almost 90%. The Philippines has approved the emergency use of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, Reuters reports. Indias daily Covid-19 deaths rose by 301, bring the total death toll to 464,153 the health ministry said. Germany reports another 52,826 confirmed coronavirus cases and 294 death, the Robert Koch Institute reports. Slovakia is planning new restrictions on unvaccinated people in an effort to tame the latest surge of coronavirus infections that has caused a critical situation in the countrys hospitals, the prime minister said Tuesday. People in Ireland are being asked to work from home where possible from Friday and bars, restaurants and nightclubs will introduce a midnight closing time on Friday as a raft of new restrictions is agreed by the government in the face of rising hospitalisations. Thousands of restaurant owners in Greece shut their businesses in a nationwide protest against recent measures that fine establishments for serving customers without proper documentation of their vaccination or test status. The UK has recorded another 37,243 Covid cases in the last 24 hours, and a further 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. That is compared with 39,705 infections and 47 deaths reported the day before. Scotlands Covid passport scheme could be extended to cinemas, theatres and bars next week if that helped avoid a harsher lockdown closer to Christmas, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. Portugal may bring back some measures to stop the spread of Covid in the run-up to the holiday season as infections soar across Europe, prime minister Antonio Costa said. In Germany, plans are under way for the introduction of tighter restrictions on people who have so far chosen not to be vaccinated. Munich became the first major German city to cancel its upcoming Christmas market, blaming the dramatic coronavirus resurgence. Berlin introduced restrictions for those who are unvaccinated on Monday.

Some employers have made it clear to staff that there is an office desk waiting for them when all the lockdown restrictions have lifted. Goldman Sachs fits this category. Others have embraced the prospect of new ways of working and invested heavily in the technology needed to overcome the barriers of distance and lack of information for those based remotely. Among those ahead of the pack is Unilever, maker of consumer goods from Dove soap to Cornettos, which before the pandemic had been trialling flexible working in all its offices, and a four-day week in its New Zealand subsidiary. Across the UK, town, city and county councillors will be waiting nervously as the debate unfolds over the coming months. Employers are likely to adapt quickly to changing need and as they do, it will become clear to local government how high the stakes are. A widespread switch to home working will alter the dynamics of plans drawn up in a previous era, affecting how high streets, homes and commercial areas are developed. Until last week, there was the real prospect of ministers telling people to go back to the office as a matter of public policy. Boris Johnson had indicated that he favoured a new normal that looked very much like the old one. Talking to staff will be crucial as employers feel their way towards a new framework This stance appears to have changed. The government is now considering legislating to make working from home the default option, by giving employees the right to request it. Hybrid working, where workers go into the office for only part of the week, already looks like becoming the norm, at least for those employed by major corporations. The implications for individuals will be profound and long-lasting. The TUC has identified a growing divide between a privileged elite of professionals who work for large employers and can demand more flexibility, and those in blue-collar jobs who find that the only flexibility on offer is to work a variety of shifts at their employers bidding. In other words, blue-collar jobs and the growing gig economy workforce will be even more tightly tied to shift patterns dictated by their employers, and these shifts will be in the workplace. The flexibility, such as it is, will mostly be for the employers benefit. To make matters worse, the next steps will probably be taken by employers based on little more than gut instinct. Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has announced a flexible working policy for its 22,000 UK staff that it said was a direct response to soundings from our people. Talking to staff will be crucial as employers feel their way towards a new framework, whether it is based on a policy of working in the office with occasional time at home, a default policy that emphasises working from home or something in between. What is more likely to happen - and would be a further deterioration in Britains amateurish industrial relations - is a rash of arbitrary decisions based on no more than the need to cut costs and a short-term drive to increase productivity. Most businesses operate with profit margins far below those enjoyed by the likes of PwC, and will put staff consultation in the category of nice to have rather than essential. It is quite possible that office-based workers will be told to work from home - or the opposite - with no account taken of their personal circumstances. The government could step in and emphasise the need for new employment practices to be developed in discussion with employees, rather than default options dictated from on high. Local government could be given more resources to support employers keen to adapt. Otherwise there could be a lurch to new working patterns that are misguided, costly - and become a matter of regret to all concerned. Sale of Channel 4 is an old repeat the Tories shouldnt be airing The idea of privatising Channel 4 has been around for a quarter of a century and the policy has never been adopted, so there is no certainty that the governments latest review will bring about a different result. But the threat of privatisation clearly exists - a decision is due by the end of this year, the Financial Times has reported - and feels more immediate this time. For example, John Whittingdale, the culture minister with responsibility for broadcast policy, was one of those early advocates of privatisation. Furthermore, the government may now argue that, in the age of Netflix and others, a dose of bracing private ownership would be good for Channel 4 itself. No one, of course, would deny that C4 is an odd beast. It is state-owned but commercially funded; profits are reinvested and it is told to attract young audiences. It is also true that the rise of streaming services will have hit its valuation: as a business it would be unlikely to attract offers of PS1bn, the estimate at the time of the last review in 2016. But the idea that the channel is some kind of hapless innocent that can only be saved by the private sector should be rejected. After losses in 2019, due partly to the cost of relocating its headquarters to Leeds, a surplus is expected for 2020. A fifth of revenues are coming from its on-demand digital platforms. The privatisation threat, then, looks driven by ideology. A private-sector owner would, one assumes, demand a freer hand to run the business purely commercially, potentially threatening its costly but important news output. And the wider danger is that Channel 4s use of independent production houses would be diluted, or lost altogether. The case for privatisation looks weak. The best solution may be just to give Channel 4 slightly more commercial freedom. A bit of biodiversity in the TV jungle is a good thing. What future for old-economy sport sponsors? Every major sports tournament has its discontent over sponsors, particularly at beer and fast food ads jostling to bask in athletes healthy glow. The belated Euro 2020 now has its own mild controversy: Cristiano Ronaldos preference for water over Coca-Cola. The Portuguese players move spawned imitators: Frances Paul Pogba moved Heineken beer bottles out of sight at a press conference, and Ukraines Andriy Yarmolenko and Italys Manuel Locatelli joined in too. England expected its men to do their duty, and manager Gareth Southgate and captain Harry Kane duly stepped in behind the sponsors. Its not something personally Ive thought too much about, said Kane, after defending Coca-Cola. Sponsorship always has risks - ask Nike about Lance Armstrong or Tiger Woods. Coca-Cola has sponsored the Euros since 1988, much to campaigners ire. With obesity now a global problem, many experts - including, it seems, Ronaldo - view regular consumption of sugary drinks and fatty foods as incompatible with a healthy lifestyle. The Euros full sponsor list is telling. The 2020 brands fall into two broad categories. There are old-economy carbon emitters such as Volkswagen - which is moving gradually away from fossil fuels - long-haul airlines like Qatar Airways, and inveterate Russian gas producer Gazprom. Then there are the tech arrivistes, such as food-ordering app Just Eat Takeaway, Chinese payments company Alipay, and video-sharing app TikTok. The presence of the latter suggests even a superstar of Ronaldos heft is highly unlikely to trigger a reassessment of sports sponsorship. Live sport still draws droves of younger viewers, and they are advertisings holy grail. That doesnt mean regularly assessing sponsors suitability isnt useful. Brands dont necessarily want to be the focus; they want to be just in view, part of the furniture, noticed only semi-consciously. We mustnt let them get too comfortable.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2023\/feb\/26\/moving-back-in-with-parents-boosts-boomerang-adults-mental-health","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2023\/feb\/26\/moving-back-in-with-parents-boosts-boomerang-adults-mental-health","DATE":"2023-02-26 07:00:15","PLAIN_TEXT":"Moving back into the parental home as an adult was once seen by many youngsters as a retrograde step and even something to be ashamed of. Now, a new study suggests that such a move actually improves the mental health of these boomerang adults, thanks in no small part to a stressful and increasingly expensive rental market. The findings of of the first study in the UK to look at the mental health impact of moving home on the adult children surprised demographers at the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER), who were expecting to find it had the opposite effect on wellbeing. Past research has found that parents experience a dip in mental health when their adult children return to live at the family home. But the new study by ISER, part of the University of Essex, found that for their children it was associated with an improvement in mental health scores - despite losing independence. We expected that probably their mental health would get worse if they had to give up their independence and that they might feel that they were falling behind their peer group and going back might seem retrograde, said professor of population science Emily Grundy, who co-authored the study with Dr Jiawei Wu. So we were quite surprised to find that on the contrary their mental health seemed to improve. While previously moving out of the family home and living independently was seen by many as a mark of adulthood, the research shows how these signifiers are changing. The whole process of things that we think are important of transition to adulthood have rather shifted, said Grundy. As well as rental costs, other factors she points to affecting young adults leaving home include people staying in education longer, getting partners and becoming parents later. Nearly 5 million adults live with their parents, according to the 2021 UK census, a 14.7% increase on 2011. Boomerang Moves and Young Adults Mental Well-being in the United Kingdom, published in Advances in Life Course Research, suggests that the so-called boomerang generation may find parental support beneficial - especially if it enables them to escape the stress of the private rental sector. Between 2009 and 2020, it found, 15% of the 9,714 British adults aged between 21 and 35 they studied moved back in with their parents at least once. The more liberal attitudes of parents could also play a role, said Grundy. At one time people had to leave home if they wanted to have boyfriends or girlfriends, whereas parents may now be less restrictive about what their children can do. The potential implications of more adults moving in with their parents include multi-generational mortgages, such as those pioneered in Japan and greater differences between generations. They used to say life begins at 40 and the idea of that was that your children were independent by then, said Grundy. Whereas now, a lot of 40-year-olds have actually got quite young children. It also means that the spacing of generations has got much more variable and there may be some people whose children come back and other people who have still got children at nursery, the whole stages of life we maybe need to have a less rigid view about. But there are huge inequalities, she warned. We looked at the people who returned home and changes in their mental health, but there are other people who perhaps cant return home because their parents havent got the resources or space. Shelter said at least two in five 25-34-year-olds say that rising living costs have increased their fear of becoming homeless and almost half say that worries over rent is making them anxious or depressed. Polly Neate, the housing charitys chief executive, condemned the chronic lack of decent affordable social homes which she said is a source of anxiety and depression for millions. But she warned families should not be left to fill the gap, which can lead to overcrowding and even exacerbate homelessness. While moving in with your family and exiting the wild west of private renting may improve younger peoples mental health, its not a solution to the housing emergency. Not everyone has a family who can take them in, others need to move for work, or they may want to start a family of their own, she said. Having more people under one roof, especially in overcrowded homes, adds extra pressure - in fact no longer being able to stay with family is a leading cause of homelessness. Generation Rent said renting in an increasingly unaffordable and competitive private rental market can have a devastating impact on mental health. Some have developed anxiety, depression or even PTSD from their experiences, said Tilly Smith, the campaigns campaigns and partnerships officer. The constant threat of an unexpected and unfair eviction notice coming through the mail at any time creates a sense of fear amongst many private tenants. Case study: Im sure I prefer my parents to strangers... luckily they have the space The first time Ella Clarke moved out of her parents home was to go to university aged 18. Since then, the 27-year-old has moved back home three times - first after graduation, then during the pandemic and just over a year ago. In November 2021, after nine months renting in London, she decided she was better off living rent-free with her parents Tim and Louise - even if she can feel she is reverting back to being a teenager. Now Im waiting to earn enough to live by myself. because rent is so high its not really worth it, said Clarke, who has started an upholstery and curtain business. Im lucky my parents have the space for me to live and work. Ella Clarke, 27, is living with her parents, Tim and Louise, and his working from home doing upholstery, curtains and other fabric interior work. Photograph: Antonio OlmosThe Observer In Colchester, where they live, renting a good quality one-bed flat would cost her around PS750 a month, she said, and a flat share doesnt appeal. Im sure I prefer my parents to strangers. She does worry about how long it will be until she can afford to move out. As much as Im happy and save money, I would very much like to have my own place. While she said the rising cost of living has a lot to do with changing generational priorities, there is also a stronger focus on career satisfaction. A lot of people are sacrificing the traditional things of moving out and having their own house and a nice car in favour of following their passion. Her parents are happy with the arrangement, she said, but it helps that her older brother lives in Australia and that she is working towards a clear aim. Im sure if Im here in 10 years time they might start asking some questions.

Since the death of the puckish Italian polymath in 1985, no fewer than six collections of his nonfiction have appeared in English, gathered into the autobiographical (The Road to San Giovanni, Hermit in Paris) or the literary-critical (Six Memos for the Next Millennium, Why Read the Classics?). So with this seventh collection, The Written World and the Unwritten World, covering a scattering of Calvinos literary writings from 1952 to 1985 and translated by Ann Goldstein, we might expect scraps from the table. Sure enough, theres some slight stuff here - a page on character names, say - but the surprise is that we get so much of substance. The greatest value is in the first section, Reading, Writing, Translating. Calvino softens us up with a playful opener on the ambitions of holiday reading (The Good Reader has decided that this summer he will really, finally, read that author), and revels in the pleasures of a good book fair, this boundless firmament of coloured covers, this dust cloud of typographical characters. We also get the lowdown on his favourite writers, a reliable if predictable bunch including Stendhal, Chekhov and Pushkin, but low on women, other than Jane Austen (no, wait: I never read her but Im glad she exists) and Katherine Mansfield. His love for fantastical literature gets its own section, and the reviews of science books are unfailingly stimulating But a reader as acute as Calvino doesnt find it easy to acquiesce with others readings of his own work. He writes to a critic who praised his book T Zero: Im pleased you find [it] likable; but the more unlikable a book... the more it counts; the more laborious it is to take in the more it counts. Yet this line is hard to square with his declaration elsewhere that entertaining readers, or at least not boring them, is my first and binding social duty - and, indeed, with the experience of reading Calvinos fiction, which is always as welcoming as it is rigorous. This balance - knotty thoughts delivered with a light touch - is evident in all his mature work, from Invisible Cities to Mr Palomar. Calvino expresses this tension between appeasing and challenging the reader another way, by saying that without the avant garde, literature dies, but that a perpetual avant garde is equally annoying. Thomas Mann, he argues, is really a 19th-century author, whereas William Faulkner shows the way forward: Either we write like that or fiction is condemned to become a minor art form. Meanwhile, Lolita is a great book because it is so many things at once, because it can shift our attention in infinite directions at the same time - a fine description of Calvinos own fiction. Calvinos work was widely translated, and working on his translations was the true way of reading oneself, of understanding what one has written and why. He admits to being a tormentor of translators (which fits with his longtime collaborator William Weavers accounts of Calvinos stubbornness in thinking he knew English well enough to choose the mot juste himself). Not everything here is essential: some pieces flounder when stripped of context, such as a letter responding to an essay we dont get to see, and whose references to the HegelianLukacsians and Bergsonism would require its own length in footnotes for the general reader to understand. But there are plenty of delights. Calvinos love for fantastical literature gets its own section, and the reviews of science books that make up the final part are unfailingly stimulating. These elements are aspects of Calvinos curiosity about ways of seeing things. In the title essay, he reflects on his unease in the real world outside books, and asks himself, Why do you want to venture into this vast world that you are unable to master? The answer, of course, was to put it on the page, to aid the rest of us helpless readers in seeing it and understanding it too. * The Written World and the Unwritten World by Italo Calvino, translated by Ann Goldstein is published by Penguin (PS10.99).

For most, the aim is a good one. But sceptics believe it may lead to people getting permission to stay in the UK without their asylum claim being properly examined. At the other end of the spectrum, its seen as an asylum crackdown, with people subjected to a process that fails to see the face behind the case. One thing that is clear is that the current asylum backlog is untenable. Ali, a claimant who escaped religious persecution and arrived in the UK in summer 2021, has now spent more than 18 months in a hotel. To be honest, being in the asylum process is like being in a prison, just without walls, he says. Its like being in limbo, and while you cant make decisions about your future, that makes you depressed. Statistics published on Thursday show that Ali is one of far too many men, women and children - more than 160,000 now - who are having to wait months and years for the Home Office to make a decision on their asylum claim. Two in three have been waiting for longer than six months; a third have been waiting between one and three years; and around 10,000 between three and five years. Addressing the backlog should be a priority for the government, and thats why the Refugee Council welcomes the commitment Rishi Sunak made last December that at least part of the backlog - the 92,000 claims that had been made before the governments latest asylum legislation, the Nationality and Borders Act, came into force at the end of June last year - would be cleared by the end of this year. Given the Home Office has only been making around 18,000 decisions each year, to fulfil this commitment will require some very different ways of working. We have been calling for a simpler process for those people who, because of the countries theyre from, will almost certainly receive a positive decision on their claim. People from places like Afghanistan and Syria. And so, on the face of it, the governments announcement that people from five countries with grant rates of 95% and over wont have to go through the normal lengthy asylum process should be a good thing. Related: Ending face-to-face interviews could be devastating for UK asylum seekers But were deeply concerned that the government risks doing the right thing in the wrong way. Instead of working with people to help them provide the information needed to make a decision, the Home Office is asking them to respond to a lengthy questionnaire that is only available in English and has to be completed in the same - and with a deadline of just four weeks. If anyone doesnt return the questionnaire, then theres a threat that the Home Office will consider their asylum claim to have been withdrawn. If that happens, theyll lose their entitlement to housing and financial support - and be at even greater risk of exploitation and destitution. Ali is well aware of this. Most asylum seekers, their English level is not good enough to fill this paper in. If they want help from someone else they will charge them, and asylum seekers are not allowed to work. These kinds of small problems, they will gather together to make a big problem, he says. So faster, more efficient, processes are vital if the prime minister is going to meet his commitment on the backlog. But doing it in this way, and at the scale proposed, wont get him there. If its done badly, all that will happen is that people will re-enter the system at a later date at untold human cost. At best, the current plans will see about 12,000 people go through the new process. It could make a huge difference - and allow people to finally get on with their lives. But thats going to leave the prime minister with another 80,000 cases that still need to be dealt with this year. Making faster grants for the thousands of unaccompanied children and focusing on the roughly 10,000 people who have been waiting for more than three years should be urgent next steps. And the backlog cant be allowed to grow again. The UN refugee agency has set out clear ways for how better triaging right at the start of the asylum process can lead to better use of Home Office resources. As it can with any public service, the government can decide if it wants the asylum system to be efficient, effective and high quality - or if it wants to neglect the system and leave it to crumble in mismanagement. The asylum system can and should be run well. Its essential the government gets this right now - for Ali, for the taxpayer and for the sake of public trust.

Two hours standing up. Or seated, but stuck in purgatory (somewhere near Hatfield), as the conductor tells passengers: Im sorry, were trapped. And thats if the train is running at all. Britains railways shouldnt be like this. In their 2019 manifesto the Conservatives promised a transport revolution, though its doubtful they planned this to involve a near rebellion on the 18:33 to Leeds. Failing railways are, however, more than a vehicle for national annoyance. Good connectivity is the lifeblood of a modern, thriving, modern economy, and a powerful symbol of whether things are going in the right direction or not. Given our ongoing rail nightmare, its becoming clear the country is on track for serious economic damage. Just how costly strikes, delays and cancellations are for the economy is tough to quantify with precision. But if the rail industry can talk up the economic benefits of new infrastructure when lobbying for funding - such as a PS42bn boost for Britain from Londons Crossrail, and PS92bn from HS2 - then the same must be true, to an extent, in reverse. Train operators reckon passengers spent PS133bn a year on food and drink, hotels, entertainment and shopping before the Covid pandemic, while suggesting that if 20% of rail usage switched to cars it could fuel an extra 1m tonnes of CO2 emissions a year and 300m hours of lost time due to extra congestion. Some of those benefits are vanishing fast. Rail cancellations have hit a record high, with more than 314,000 fully or partly cancelled trains in Great Britain in the year to October. Rail users in the north of England are bearing the brunt, with Avanti West Coast, TransPennine Express and Northern the worst culprits. The combination of Avantis poor service and strikes has been devastating. The service is so poor and so unpredictable that people arent planning to travel. Photograph: Luciana GuerraPA Jeff Nash, owner of the Potbank aparthotel in Stoke-on-Trent, knows a thing or two about the costs of rail chaos. Just a 10-minute walk from the station on the site of the old Spode pottery works, the disruption is costing his business thousands of pounds in cancelled bookings. The combination of Avantis poor service and strikes has been devastating. The service is so poor and so unpredictable that people arent planning to travel. Recent strikes cost two days of bookings, losing him more than PS3,000. The biggest losses come when big events are on, or Stoke City are playing at home. Hes also stopped making his own regular business trips to London. Its the poor service by Avanti thats worse than the strikes, he says. The website has no availability if you want to go to London in two weeks time. It asks you to register for notifications. As if its dont call us, well call you if were going to run a train. Then theres a mad scramble, like youre queueing for a Taylor Swift concert or something. But this is really important infrastructure were talking about. Analysts at the Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank estimate that strikes alone could cost the economy almost PS700m in lost output, by stopping people from getting to work who cannot do their job from home. Meanwhile, the hospitality industry says strikes could cost the sector PS1.5bn, similar to the level of disruption caused by the Omicron wave of Covid last year. The impact of disruption on the railways could be minimised. More people are able to Zoom in to meetings from home since the Covid pandemic, while some of the work of those who cant get to work due to train problems will be carried out by other staff, or performed on another day instead. Before the pandemic only about 10% of people in Britain commuted by rail (including the London Underground), mostly in the capital and big cities. Almost half worked in IT, finance and professional services, so are more likely to be able to work from home. And as anyone driving into a big town on a weekday morning knows, most people commute by car. However, these are not excuses for allowing the railways to crumble. People taking fewer car journeys is vital for hitting net zero carbon, while face-to-face meetings will always remain important. Not all jobs can or should be done remotely. Even after Covid, good transport links remain a key reason for businesses and their people to pick one place or another to locate. Speak to train operating companies and they would acknowledge there have been economic consequences from strikes and other cancellations, at a time when they want to encourage more people back on to the railways after Covid. Reflecting lower passenger numbers, rail operators revenues are 20% down on 2019 levels, while strike action has cost up to PS300m since June in lost sales. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, said it had spelled out to unions the impact that destructive and counter-productive strikes were having on the wider economy. The devastating impact of the pandemic simply made more urgent the case for long-needed reforms to working practices. The industry argues that reforms will help fund higher pay for an updated workforce, while putting the railways on a more sustainable footing, and cutting reliance on taxpayer subsidies after a PS16bn bailout during the Covid pandemic. For its part, the government says its committed to helping the industry reform and modernise to ensure it can offer value for money. However, there is a strong case for more investment by the state, not less. While Boris Johnsons levelling up agenda largely tried to make empty rhetoric look solid, where the former prime minister was right was to promote the importance of better transport for breaking down regional inequalities. It was a vote winner in 2019 that has resulted in zero change whatsoever. Where Johnson got it wrong was to focus on investment in physical infrastructure, without giving enough thought to what really makes a good service work: its people. If by modernisation rail operators and the government mean inadequate pay, fewer staff and unreasonable changes to working conditions, they clearly do not recognise the importance of railways to Britain. A rethinking of outdated transport ideas is required. Instead of allowing the rail network to wither on the vine while pumping more money into road building, the government must come up with real solutions. More investment in transport and people is key. There are heavy economic costs without it.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/feb\/26\/think-wfh-means-your-boss-isnt-watching-you-think-again","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/feb\/26\/think-wfh-means-your-boss-isnt-watching-you-think-again","DATE":"2022-02-26 16:00:48","PLAIN_TEXT":"Pandemics, as the historian Yuval Noah Harari observed at the beginning of the current one, tend to accelerate history. If you doubt that then think back to, say, January 2020. If you told people then that by April that year major corporations would be insisting that most of their staff worked from home, they would have given you funny looks and checked for the nearest exit. Nobody then had heard of Zoom and something called video conferencing was considered either a geeky affectation or the last resort of organisations that could not afford air fares for senior executives to go to Rotterdam or Las Vegas for a one-hour meeting. And then, in the blink of an eye, working from home had become not just an acronym - WFH - but a cliche and Zoom, like Google before it, had become a verb as well as a noun. The tiresome daily commute shrank to padding from bedroom to kitchen to a laptop on a desk. For an initial period, utopian visions of better work-life balances blossomed. But then the new reality dawned: instead of us going to the office, the office had come to us and we were working, eating and sleeping in it. Still, we had a bit more autonomy WFH than we had in the office under the beady-eyed surveillance of managers. Or so we thought. But capitalism - and its servant, technology - never sleeps. Those managers, who had always regarded WFH as some kind of work-avoidance scam, realised that digital technology was just the ticket for keeping an eye on their newly remote subordinates. It would make sure that they werent idly browsing Pinterest, or bidding on eBay, or doing private emails, or a thousand other unproductive things, on the companys dime. And so a swarm of tech companies evolved to service those paranoid suspicions. Thus was born the new industry of little tech. Coworker.org is an admirable American non-profit organisation that builds digital tools and communities for employees to share information, form collectives and advocate for change. It also campaigns to prevent employers from dismantling hard-won employment rights through increasingly sophisticated surveillance, data-mining and the fragmentation of the workplace. And it has recently published a sizable database of companies that make bossware - software for enabling employers to keep a close eye on staff who are working from home. The first thing that strikes one browsing through the database entries is that employers seeking intrusive surveillance of their homeworkers have a wide number of tools to choose from, ranging from software for general oversight (sometimes benign, as in detecting inappropriate or inadvertent attempts to share confidential files) to monitoring of a really creepy kind. Instead of us going to the office, the office had come to us and we were working, eating and sleeping in it One company (chosen at random) describes itself as purveyor of a robust, state-of-the-art technology that makes employee tracking simple and effective. Its keystroke and activity tracking feature helps keep track of keystroke and mouse-click activity of remote employees and can detect and send alerts about suspicious keyloggers, false keystrokes and prohibited data-copy attempts to the management. And so on. Another, billed as Your Favorite Small Business Employee Monitoring Tool asks if you know how much time your employees spend working. Personal use of employers computers is widespread beyond imaginable. Track their computer activities and learn whose performance is exemplary and who is abusing their workplace. Most of these blurbs for broad privacy intrusions come coated with three coats of prime corporate cant about ethics and consent, which should raise a hollow laugh from employees who will see them - accurately - as amounting to this: accept this or look for work elsewhere. Coworker.org has also released a 73-page report, Little Tech Is Coming for the Workers, which makes interesting reading. Among other things, it reveals that little tech isnt so little: the database includes 550 companies. They include some giants that have worker-surveillance products in their portfolios, but a lot of smaller outfits that most of us have never heard of. The report says that venture capital, private equity and hedge funds are channelling record-breaking investments into the expansion of this unregulated marketplace whose products erode labour standards for workers and exploit weak labour protections. For these investors, the lack of regulation is a feature, not a bug. As is the fact that the technology is a force for, as the report puts it, depersonalisation and dehumanisation. This industry revealed by Coworker.orgs research may be little tech, but in key respects its just aping its bigger brother. Reading through the blurbs puffing its products, one comes away with the same feeling one gets from inspecting the algorithmic tools of the tech giants. In both cases, software written by a small elite is designed to monitor, classify and exploit ordinary people in ways that the programmers and their corporate masters would never themselves tolerate. And in that sense its just another example of how power corrupts those who possess it.

However, the very data that he refers to paints a different picture. Marks makes his main point by referring to the fact that almost two-thirds of workers would like more in-person time with their teams. This, however, does not prove that they want to go back to the office full-time. On the contrary, the study shows that 70% of the workforce prefers a more flexible way of working in the future.

But there are also wider societal reasons for working predominantly in an office rather than at home. Apart from prison or a long spell in hospital, the workplace is the one place in adult life where we have no choice but to mix daily with people whom we would otherwise not necessarily choose to, or have the chance to. That is why the workplace has been the front line for successive UK and other governments trying to shift societal attitudes through anti-discrimination laws. Those laws are not perfect and implementation is patchy between different workplaces. But in an increasingly polarised world, we need more opportunities for people of different backgrounds and perspectives to mix regularly, not fewer. Tempting though it may be to reduce overheads by giving up expensive premises and moving to a virtual working world, we do so at our peril. Workplaces can also be a great equaliser in terms of access to resources and opportunities, mitigating the disadvantages faced by those who have no suitable space to work at home or who have no role model at home to teach them the softer skills of working life. While it is reassuring that we now know millions can work completely from home when we need to, when we are free to choose, we ought to choose not to.Jane FieldingPartner and UK head of employment, labour and equalities, Gowling WLG * Have an opinion on anything youve read in the Guardian today?

Born during or after the 1980s, when governments began radically restructuring the economy to prioritise private gains over public good, millennials and Gen Z have only known their country as harsh and self-interested. This cohort entered a job market teeming with insecure work and disposable labour, a welfare system geared to create low wages, and a housing system designed to generate income for investors and landlords, rather than house people. The poorest young people have fallen the furthest. Home ownership for the bottom 20% of 25-34-year-old income earners has fallen over 40 percentage points since the 1980s to under 23% - one of the largest falls in the OECD. Many children of renters stare down a lifetime of poverty. But comfortable living standards for young people and future generations does not come at the expense of that of older Australians. This claim relies on the flawed notion that there is only a certain amount of resources to go around. It relies on us believing the size of the pie is fixed, but its not. Related: Australias richest 1% pocketed $150,000 a minute over past decade, Oxfam research finds The federal governments recent proposed changes to super concessions for a tiny pool of multimillionaires shows how easily ruffled the gold feathers of the wealthy can be. Intergenerational warfare is a key weapon in the richs attempts to naturalise and obfuscate their wealth and power. False equivalence is their first tactic. By creating a fantasy world where everyone is an average mum and dad, state-funded landlordism can be equated to pension plans, allowing the rich to claim attacks on retirees. But maintaining multi-billion-dollar tax breaks to a wealthy minority is, of course, not the same as providing secure retirements. Australias $53bn a year outlays on super concessions, nabbed mostly by the rich, now outweigh the pension bill, which supports almost 2 million people - and currently fails to keep them out of poverty. Australias tax concessions are empire building, and poles apart from the egalitarian social compact to support working people in old age. If the old rich were forgoing holidays and nice cars to accumulate funds over $3m, how were they planning to spend their bounties in the last 20 years of life, anyway? Yacht parties? Another tactic is the classic divide and conquer. Blame people when they become ensnared in policies designed to fail them, and pin their material stagnation on personal failure or weakness. The cost of avocado on toast, iPhones and other new consumer goods apparently plugs the income cavern of exploding house prices, now a record-high 8.5 times median earnings. If only young people could show restraint, like fiscal conservatives do. Take the retired 68-year-old Sydneysider who accused millennials of failing to make sacrifices to buy a home like her. Later, it was revealed she was a former general manager of Merivale, a hospitality behemoth accused in 2020 of $129m in wage theft - mostly from young workers. Is this really mum and dad? An economic model putting private gains before public good needs cheerleaders, and the recent super debate exposes the minority of Australians who were bought off with taxpayer dollars. Theyll keep making noise. Meanwhile, the big businesses reaping record profits under the status quo need people to believe ghoulish views like those of Merivales former general manager are representative all old people. Related: Labor and Greens senators back four-day work week But most older people seek to forge mutual social bonds across generations. They acknowledge young people will be worse off over their lifetimes, and want action. Many want younger Australians to have more political power. For young Australians, their demands are modest, and familiar to older generations: the opportunity for decent work, a secure home, choices about family formation, and free education. And this is a worthy goal, not a sin. How can we reach across generations and build a better Australia? Innovating the architecture of a new modern Fair Go requires that we transcend the warfare tropes and embrace a new kind of intergenerational politics - one based on solidarity and collectivism. As Donald Horne reminds us, politics isnt just for politicians, the media and elites. In politics, we all have the right to consider ourselves experts. By working together for a new vision of government that creates plentiful good jobs, social housing, a non-punitive social security system and more, we can extend the golden years to a new generation. This vision requires we derail the public-subsidised gravy trains. It means dragging big untaxed wealth to the table to contribute to the nations future in young people. A bigger pie, better shared.

With patients she had a great personal touch, characterised by openness and a willingness to listen.

Maggie was born in Cardiff to Jewish parents, Gisela, a Czech doctor, and Conrad, a Romanian lawyer, who had fled Czechoslovakia in 1939 and found refuge in Wales. Her father died while Maggie was studying at St Pauls school for girls in London, to where the family had moved after the second world war.

She qualified as a doctor in 1972 and three years later joined her first GP practice in Lewisham, where she was part of a radical collective in which all staff took home exactly the same rate of pay whatever their position. After three years there she moved northwards and took over the practice in Shipley until her retirement in 2007, although she retained her involvement in the Bradford GP training scheme until 2015.

Not so in the UK, Japan, Germany, France and most other rich countries around the world, where parents - including fathers in some cases - can take significant time off after a child is born, with part of their compensation being covered by the government. The US has no such benefit. Federal law mandates employers to allow their employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act and it seems very unlikely that a national paid leave requirement will become legislation anytime soon. However, some states have picked up the ball. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 11 states - California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington - and the District of Columbia currently offer paid family and medical leave, all of which are funded through employee-paid payroll taxes, and some of which are also partially funded by employer-paid payroll taxes. With the lack of government assistance, have US employers stepped up to provide this important benefit? Unfortunately, the opposite is happening. A recent study of approximately 3,000 employers by the Society for Human Resource Management, reported in the Wall Street Journal, found that the share of employers offering paid maternity leave beyond what is required by law dropped to 35% this past year, which is down from 53% in 2020. The share of employers giving paid paternity time off fell to 27% in 2022, from 44% in 2020. Rising costs and a desire to return to pre-pandemic norms are some of the reasons cited for this trend. For business owners, parental leave is costly and disruptive. Some companies - like HPE, Etsy, Dropbox, Netflix and Lululemon Athletica - offer six months or more of paid leave for both primary and secondary caregivers. But these are large companies. Its more difficult for many small businesses to lose a key employee for an extended period of time. For employees, however, parental leave can be a very important benefit because the time off is potentially needed to adjust to a significant personal change. Having to shoulder the responsibilities of a job during those first few weeks or months after birth can be very difficult. This is a tricky issue, particularly for a small business with fewer resources than a larger organization. And there are tricky questions to answer. Is it biased to offer paid leave to new parents? What about those who dont or cant have children? Is it fair to tell a new mother or father that you need them to be responsible for at least some of their work duties from home, now that we know remote working is valid option? How long can a small business owner keep a job open without operations being significantly affected? How long can we afford to cut a paycheck every week when no work is being done? Related: Its time for US small businesses to care about mental health Tricky, but not insurmountable. Based on what Ive seen from my smartest clients, here are a few thoughts that may help answer these questions. First, if a small business has fewer than 50 employees, it doesnt need to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act. But, thanks to the Section 45S employer credit - a relatively little-known tax rule that was extended through 2025 - if a business allows an employee to take the time off and continues to pay at least half of their wages, the company can receive a tax credit for up to 25% of the wages paid. So that could help with the cost. Speaking of tax benefits, an employer can deduct up to $5,000 a year in contributions to an employees flexible spending account (FSA), which can be used for childcare and is not taxable to the employee. There are limitations to this deduction and time should be invested - and professionals consulted - for both the business owner and employee to better understand how the personal childcare tax credit works and how it can potentially be used in addition to the FSA so their employees can maximize those benefits too. You will also need to make some tough decisions that address some of the concerns over bias and working from home. I believe a business should include parental leave as part of its companys paid time off plan in order to avoid any claims of bias from other employees who do not or did not have children. But be aware that this is potentially controversial and could have an impact on retaining and recruiting workers. The good news is that one of the many benefits of being a small employer is that you can be flexible and do not have to adhere to a rigid corporate policy.

I did it because I wanted a new career that would draw on all that I have learned in half a lifetime, and allow me to contribute to my community in the best way I know how. Im just six months into my four-year graduate medicine degree and its already the biggest challenge of my life. Ive had a range of jobs, from driving public buses through peak-hour traffic, building houses and wooden boats, working as a clown in community circuses and as halftime entertainment for the Super League, and even feeding massive saltwater crocodiles to entertain tourists. Related: Against a surging Omicron adept at immune escapism, boosters and masks are Australias best weapons | Catherine Bennett But it was during my 17 years as an ABC journalist in the Kimberley while raising my family in Broome that I fell in love with a beautiful and troubled community. I learned there that all jobs have their drudgery but it was the moments when I felt my work made a small positive contribution that gave me the greatest sense of satisfaction. Much of daily journalism is the churn of local news and events but, as I developed friendships and connections in the Kimberley, I was increasingly able to tell stories of the people who pushed back and overcame the terrible history of colonialism, racism and trauma that still shapes the lives of many people today. Those meaningful stories were just a tiny part of my work and, with the ABC cutting the pay of regional journalists, I wanted a new challenge. As ridiculous as studying medicine at my age seemed, I just couldnt come up with an alternative that excited me enough to risk throwing in my career. But I almost gave up before I started when I realised the closest place I could study medicine was more than 2,000km away in Perth - and that was only if I could get past some major hurdles to entry. Most Australian medical students start six years of university study straight out of high school after gaining entry with top marks in the university clinical aptitude test. But people like me who are older and have a university degree can try their luck with the graduate Australian medical school admissions test. Gamsat is four and a half hours of science, maths, humanities and two written essays. Its designed so the average mark is about 50%. To get 60 is doing well, get 70 and youre in the top 10% of the 10,000-odd hopefuls who take the exam each year. It took me about two years for my wife and I to decide that I would take a shot at this notoriously tough exam, then face all the challenges that it would bring to our family if I was successful. It had been almost 20 years since I completed a degree in science, so I spent about 15 months preparing for the Gamsat. I was finally ready in March 2021 but the closest location I could sit the exam was in Perth, two hours flying time away. So far I have found studying medicine is like doing three science degrees simultaneously The exam fee was $500 so, with flights and a hotel, it would cost $2,000 before I could even pick up a pencil. While I was more than comfortable travelling to remote locations to report for the ABC in often difficult circumstances, heading into the centre of the city to take that exam with so much riding on it was one of the hardest challenges Ive faced. My sleep was riddled with bizarre dreams, my appetite vanished and I felt like a zombie crowding into the building with hundreds of other exam hopefuls, mostly half my age. But my preparation paid off. The six months after the exam involved painfully complex administrative hurdles, applying to medical schools and doing interviews via Zoom. In November the University of Western Australia offered me a place in its doctor of medicine degree. While I felt as though Id won the lottery, the celebrations were tainted by the reality that we now had to pack up our lives, say goodbye to our community, rent out our home and find a new one in Perth, and enrol our two youngest kids in new schools in a matter of weeks. It has been a big challenge for my whole family, especially my two boys to adapt to new schools in the city after only knowing life in Broome. Its only been six months and weve all had some tough times. Related: Covid covid covid, everyone is getting covid covid covid | First Dog on the Moon So far I have found studying medicine is like doing three science degrees simultaneously, such is the volume of work. Ive also learnt that heating a small townhouse produces a power bill almost equivalent to an entire fortnightly Austudy payment. But it has already been immensely rewarding and exciting, and we have all learnt we are more adaptable and resilient than we realised. Our future is still unknown but occasionally I allow myself to imagine returning to Broome as a doctor. At 51, I will be a pretty old junior doctor, with so much still to learn about medicine. But I hope that my other experiences in work and also in being a part of the town, a parent, a volunteer, knowing the people and their history, will help turn me into a doctor who can make a small contribution towards making my community a better place.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2023\/feb\/02\/energy-regulator-launches-british-gas-investigation-over-prepayment-meters","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2023\/feb\/02\/energy-regulator-launches-british-gas-investigation-over-prepayment-meters","DATE":"2023-02-02 10:28:16","PLAIN_TEXT":"The energy regulator has launched an investigation into British Gas after it emerged that agents working on its behalf ignored customers vulnerabilities. Ofgem said it would not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against the energy supplier after it was alleged that Arvato Financial Solutions, a company used by British Gas to pursue debts, had broken into homes to fit meters when there were signs that young children and people with disabilities lived in the property. British Gas customers who have had their meters fitted by force recently included a mother whose daughter is disabled and has a hoist and [an] electric wheelchair and a woman in her 50s described in job notes as severe mental health bipolar, a Times investigation found. Graham Stuart, the energy minister, was due to meet with British Gas on Thursday afternoon. A spokesman for the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: Vulnerable families should not be treated so poorly. The findings suggest that British Gas has failed to use every possible avenue to support those struggling with energy bills, as they rightly deserve and are entitled to. Separately on Thursday, Ofgem named British Gas among a string of suppliers it said needed to improve their customer service after an extensive review. An Ofgem spokesperson said: It is unacceptable for any supplier to impose forced installations on vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills before all other options have been exhausted and without carrying out thorough checks to ensure it is safe and practicable to do so. We have launched a major market-wide review investigating the rapid growth in prepayment meter installations and potential breaches of licences driving it. We are clear that suppliers must work hard to look after their customers at this time, especially those who are vulnerable. The energy crisis is no excuse for unacceptable behaviour towards any customer, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances. British Gas has suspended the use of court warrants to force the installation of prepayment meters in response. It had stopped switching people on to prepayment meters remotely through smart meters after complaints about the practice. MPs and consumer groups have raised concerns that elderly and disabled people are being forced on to prepayment meters and then routinely cut off from heat and power as they could not afford to top up. Citizens Advice said this month that 3.2 million people - one person every 10 seconds - were last year being left in cold and dark homes as they ran out of credit. Ofgems customer service review of the 17 biggest domestic energy suppliers found evidence that suppliers were not picking up phone calls and provided inconsistent scripts for staff handling complex inquiries, while up to 50% of customers gave up and hung up as calls went answered. It identified severe weaknesses with E.ON, saying its waiting times and abandoned call rates were very poor and represented a severe deterioration since its last analysis. Ofgem said it had found moderate weaknesses in the service provided by British Gas, E Gas &amp; Electricity, EDF, Good Energy, Outfox the Market, Ovo, ScottishPower, So Energy, Utilita, Utility Warehouse and TruEnergy. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said: From being on hold for too long, to not being given clear information, or sometimes not getting through to suppliers at all, this review has highlighted that customer service is just not good enough. Nearly 30 suppliers have collapsed since the start of the energy crisis in 2021 while consumers have seen their bills more than triple.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/mar\/05\/upward-spiral-inside-a-chic-antwerp-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/mar\/05\/upward-spiral-inside-a-chic-antwerp-home","DATE":"2022-03-05 16:00:28","PLAIN_TEXT":"There is both stillness and movement in Caroline de Wolfs Belgian home. Its defining feature is the monumental staircase, based on the central spiral ramp in New Yorks Guggenheim Museum, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Inspired by their love of the visionary American architect, De Wolf and her husband, engineer-turned-designer Joris Van Apers, built the house in Duffel, just south of Antwerp, in 2000. It was designed by Van Apers, who was working as an engineer at the time. He now runs the family business, Joris Van Apers BV, which is both a design studio and a supplier of reclaimed wood. De Wolf is the CFO. The couples passion for wood, and for nature, is a unifying feature of a space governed by architectural flow. Lines of beauty: dramatic Paul Klee colours and the reclaimed pine-beamed ceiling in the living room. Photograph: VerlindeLivinginside.com The different rhythms of the house follow the rhythm of the staircase, says De Wolf. Rising through all three levels of the house, the spiral construction is made of a mixture of plaster and hard micro-cement. The treads are pine. All levels and rooms lead to the staircase, like the branches of a tree to their trunk. When youre in the hot tub with the windows open, its like being outside in the bath We wanted a house with open spaces that connected with nature and lots of light, but we also wanted warmth and intimacy, says De Wolf of the 5,400sqft three-bedroom home. A mixture of materials, including a range of reclaimed woods, slate tiles reclaimed from a monastery, and lime-finished walls, provide warm hues as well as texture. In the living room, the dynamic interplay of colours that characterise Paul Klees paintings was the starting point. The vivid red of paired shelving is picked up in De Wolfs favourite artworks, two abstract paintings by Belgian artist Michel Mouffe installed over the slate fireplace. A Murano glass table lamp, golden curtains and panelled ceiling offset lime-washed teal walls and the two inviting 1930s blue lounge chairs - by Czech designer Jindrich Halabala - gather around another standout piece, the coffee table by the Belgian artist and designer Ado Chale. Going with the flow: the kitchen with staircase behind. Photograph: VerlindeLivinginside.com This is a home for moving between spaces and relaxing, but glance up and you see not only the reclaimed pine-beamed ceiling, inspired by New Yorks Gramercy Park Hotel, but also the railings of the fitness centre at half-level, used by the couples two daughters, 17 and 14. A passerelle, or bridge, designed to add depth and geometry, connects the fitness area to the girls bedrooms. Theres also a pool in the garden, heated year-round for daily swimming and, in the main bedroom up in the eaves, a hot tub is concealed beneath a deep, pine window seat. The different rhythms of the house follow the rhythm of the staircase: Caroline De Wolf and Joris Van Apers. Photograph: VerlindeLivinginside.com Lift the pine seat, climb in and, with the windows open, it creates the feeling of being outside in the bath, and a strong connection to nature, says De Wolf. When the hot tub is closed you can sit, relax, read or meditate on the window sill. Versatile and housing concealed storage, these resting quarters (bedroom doesnt do the space justice) are both functional and calming. A television is hidden inside a nutwood trunk at the foot of the bed and theres a dressing room behind double pine doors. We were looking for intimacy and a place to relax, says De Wolf, a bedroom not just for sleeping, but also for tranquillity and peace. The hot tub, she says, shows off her husbandss playfulness, as well as his fondness for secret, surprising places. In both the main bedroom and bathroom the rich grains of wood and the use of textured fabric counter the almost ascetic feel created by the lime-washed walls, steel windows and steel-framed glass partitioning. Theres something monastic - and chic - about it. In fact, the term boutique monastic could be coined just for this house. Soap opera: the family bathroom.

In the bathroom, York stone tiles on the floor complement an antique Italian nutwood counter salvaged from an old bank, and customised ceramic basins. We love the tactility, the structure of wood, and the fact that it is a natural material, says De Wolf. Belgian beauty: the boutique monastic house. Photograph: VerlindeLivinginside.com Its downstairs in the living and dining area that the family spend most of their time. This is where we relax together as a family, says De Wolf. The big oak table, designed and made by Joris, is used as a work table and as a dining table. The tiles on the kitchen island, also designed by Van Apers - as were so many features of the house - were handmade by a French ceramicist named Regula Brotbek. In characteristic attention to detail, the pattern was inspired by a vase Brotbek designed for Van Aperss mother. The slate worktop was made in the companys studio. The kitchen looks out on to the garden on three sides. We love the contact with nature when we are sitting here, says De Wolf.

The studio was packed with hundreds of works of art. For the past four years I had been working with the Syrian writer Professor Ali Souleman and the documentary filmmaker Mark Jones. Ali lost his sight in a bomb blast in Syria in 1997 and we had been attempting to translate his experiences of war and displacement into a collection of paintings - to make the unseen seen. Ali and Mark were coming the very next day for an unveiling. The studio was overstuffed, no pause or resting place for the eye anywhere. It was, in hindsight, a self-portrait of a restless mind. Ive always been driven by obsessive-compulsive tendencies: counting and control, endless tinkering, seeking a never-coming calm. A patch of work caught my eye. Could it be a bit more darkened and burnt? I felt an itch behind my eyelid, a twitching fidget. I should have waited until I could move the boxes. I couldnt wait. I switched on the blowtorch and passed it over the surface. It would only take a moment. A moment was all it took. The painting caught in an instant, a small flame flickering into life. Calm attempts to stem it soon turned to panic as the fire began to spread across the wall. Dread set in. Efforts to douse the flames became increasingly desperate. Within minutes the entire back wall was aflame, the studio thick with black, billowing smoke. I stumbled through the dark, choking, to the door. I called the fire brigade, screaming to the neighbours. Smoke stuck in my throat, reaching deep inside my lungs. The double doors to the studio were a bright- orange rectangle, waves of black smoke roiling out and upwards. I was breathless, crying, my body dripping with sweat, my eyes full of fire. It took the fire brigade four hours to extinguish the studio. Everything inside was gone; a decade of my work destroyed. In minutes the back wall was aflame, the studio thick with smoke The following weeks were consumed by the clear up. My wife was abroad, so my mother and stepfather came to look after me and help me work though the initial logistics, hiring a water pump, buying wellies and a torch, tackling the arduous bureaucracy of insurance. I was inundated with offers of help from family, friends, neighbours and strangers, in real life and on social media. But soon I realised I had to tackle this alone. I confronted the scale of destruction piece by piece, a slow act of mourning. It was a personal taxonomy, a museum of loss as I identified and ordered the burnt remains. Wet ash gathered into bags. Fragments of stretcher bars arranged by size. Burnt canvases dragged out and organised. A slow documentation of what things might have been and what they now were. Inside a deep well of sadness was building, burned away by flushes of anger and resentment at my reckless, manic obsessiveness. Ali and Mark came to visit the studio a week after the fire, to witness the loss. We worked our way through what remained, looking through touch and description as I guided Alis hand across surface after surface: wooden stretchers stripped of canvas, crumbling under Alis fingers. We began to feel an uncomfortable sense of recognition here. The entire studio, with its array of damage, shards of shattered glass and the skeleton substructures of paintings, was uncannily reminiscent of aerial views across a bombed-out city, like drone shots across Aleppo or city views from the street level of Damascus, rows of blown open buildings, their interior damage revealed. In some cruel alchemy the fire had transformed, rather than destroyed, the paintings into the most literal and visceral recreation of the world Ali had fled a few years before. In a sense we had achieved what we set out to do. The safe space between the two worlds of painting and reality was blown apart by the fire. Later, Ali told me he felt the same unnerving sense of the strange and familiar, of worlds colliding. We moved house, and I made the decision to keep all the burnt remains. Suddenly the remnants no longer read just as fragmentary memories of a lost past. I began to see their potential to hold new life, new possibilities. Some objects leant themselves to transformation: melted paint pots could be covered in resin, transforming into gleaming sculptures, as if dredged from a wreck. There were objects that could be photographed as research material for new work and materials that could be repurposed - ash and charcoal, burnt stretcher bars, book pages to be incorporated into paintings. In the two years since the fire, these remains have become integral to my work. Ive mixed ash into paint, collaged burnt stretcher bars and debris into sculptural paintings, embedded various materials into resin-soaked canvases. Theyve even formed the basis for the illustrations I did for the award-winning childrens story Julia and the Shark. The remnants of the fire were feeding and forming everything I was making. The new canvases are not remotely like the paintings that came before: there is no violence, less darkness. Ive been attempting to make paintings which speak to connection, reaching towards empathy. The noise of previous work gave way to something quieter: to melancholy and perhaps even to beauty. To love. More than anything the fire has forced change on me. It has made me approach painting and life in a new way - with more thought and appreciation. Instead of making a dozen large paintings in a month, I will fold a painted canvas and leave it in the garden for weeks, letting it build up layer by layer, removing paint with bleach, adding foot and hand prints into the surface, encrusted and considered with deep attention. Instead of burnt landscapes, I paint abstract galaxies populated by floating limbs. In place of screaming mouths, constellations of colour floating over one another. But its a slow accumulation. I am approaching everything with more care, clarity and calm. This has necessitated a rewiring of my brain, a concentration of the richness of the current moment, an antidote to relentless internal noise and anxiety. It is not that the obsessive-compulsive tendencies have gone. My brain is still dialled into a manic frequency, but a kind of harmony has been found with the chaos. A desire to see better. These new works are complex - I didnt think I was this capable Eighteen months after my studio burned, Ali and Mark came to see these new works. Mark filmed Ali and me working slowly through the paintings. I directed Alis hand across the surface, his fingers offered roots into a different kind of vision. Touch as sight. It was an exercise in joint exploration, a kind of meditation. It reminded me of the magic of painting, to slow time, to offer up an absolute concentration of the present, on the exchange between viewer and canvas. More than that, I realised these new paintings are the best Ive ever made, works of technical complexity and a tenderness I never thought I was capable of before. The fire was the product of a brain that refused to switch off, an inability to silence my obsessive-compulsive patterns of thinking and action. In the weeks and months afterwards, I was all guilt, bitterness and self-hatred. It was my fault, the loss of all that work, the destruction of a joint project. Everything felt so fragile, the slippery reality of mortality so present. But now I look back and realise it is more complex. That same manic drive led to the work being made in the first place. It has driven all my projects, all my successes as well as my failures. It has allowed me to see the burnt remains not as an end, as pure destruction, but as an endless set of possibilities. Showing Ali the new work, considering the slow mode in which all these works had been made and were being viewed, caused a total shift. If the fire was the trigger for change, forcing me to seek therapy and transform the way I work, I am now reaping the rewards. The main joy has been learning how to occupy the present moment, no longer endlessly moving forward or circling pointlessly. In noticing and accepting how my brain works, Im better able to manage and divert my energy into creativity. These strange neurological quirks, which for so long had felt like destructive traps, have started to feel like a gift.

Sometimes theres a flood or a huge JCB digger has gone through your power supply, says the founder of Daunt Books, and managing director of Waterstones. You might run the power from the guy next door, or sometimes youre literally going round with a torch collecting books for customers in the gloom. But this winter could present a very different challenge. If gas supplies run too low, the government has crisis plans for a series of rolling three-hour power cuts, with regions of the UK taking it in turn to go dark. This week, the Guardian revealed that officials have also dusted down Programme Yarrow, which would kick in if there were a complete nationwide blackout. It involves prioritising food, water and shelter for the young and for older people, and examines how to communicate with the public. Only hospitals, oil refineries and certain other critical services would be protected. One of the last big power cuts, in August 2019, hit a million customers electricity supplies, and caused chaos for rail, road and air commuters. Shop tills froze, IT systems crashed and factories shut down. Thousands of bosses across the country are working out how to prepare their businesses for the worst-case scenarios. In retail, ensuring that stores can still trade is prioritised. Waterstones till systems are backed up with uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units, which can work offline. When the power comes back, all the money flows through, says Daunt. The UPS units cannot provide enough power for adequate lighting but you carry on in the gloom - customers are very tolerant of it. At other shops without these backups, transactions become near impossible in an increasingly cashless economy. As the threatened three-hour blackouts are designed to be evenly spread across the country, Daunt believes that it could be swings and roundabouts for his 300 stores nationwide, depending on where and when the cuts fall. For supermarkets - with huge supply chains, chillers and lighting requirements - energy is a huge resource. Sainsburys this week said it can control ventilation and lighting in stores and can be very agile in responding to issues, although it is not stocking up on generators for each store. Waitrose says the vast majority of our main buildings have secondary power supplies. Icelands boss, Richard Walker, says the retailer is in the process of mapping out our future energy requirements and is installing solar panels at its shops and warehouses. He concedes, however, that nationwide blackouts would make it difficult to keep shops open. In the City, where lost trading time could cost millions of pounds, catastrophe protocols are being studied. Banks in London may use locations beyond the Square Mile, mainly in Essex and Surrey, which were called upon in the pandemic. JPMorgan has said it has contingency plans for all its locations, and can even move staff between offices in different countries. The trade body UK Finance says firms are making sure their ducks are in a row and studying precedents in markets such as South Africa, where power cuts are commonplace. Typically, City firms have at least 72 hours of backup generator power, as well as on-site engineers. Industries where being efficient with time is crucial are particularly exposed to power cuts. A senior newspaper executive says it has a Mary Celeste-style empty office far from its central London newsroom to ensure it can continue to publish in an emergency on tight deadlines. The site has capacity for about 30 core editors and production staff. The office is meant to be used in the case of some form of disaster. It has a backup generator, which is tested regularly, he says. Improvements in technology allowing people to work from home have made it slightly less important - the key is to have remote access to your core system and protect your server. Home working will be reliant on robust telecoms, but this is an industry used to outages, typically caused by problems such as storms, and falling trees hitting overhead lines. BT operates 6,000 UK exchanges, each of which has a backup generator. Simon Lowth, BTs chief financial officer, said this week it has held talks with the government about potentially using the generators for wider public use to help cope with demand at peaks. Its ubiquitous green cabinets, seen on Britains street corners, which provide broadband connections, have four hours of backup power. The British Gas owner Centrica advises businesses that, rather than protect an entire site from electricity loss at huge cost, they should prioritise essential systems. Certain industries simply cannot function in darkness: blackouts in the West End in 2016 forced performances to be scrapped at some of the countrys best known venues. Some consumers have begun contingency planning. Demand for airfryers, electric blankets and energy monitors had already soared as shoppers sought to cut bills. Now, Google Trends data shows a sharp increase in searches for portable power packs and torches. The slightly apocalyptic scenario has also piqued the interest of survivalists, or preppers, who proactively prepare for emergencies. A Reddit discussion among preppers on the prospect of UK blackouts shows users encouraging each other to buy bio-ethanol fires, USB-powered electric blankets, dry pre-packaged meals, water filters and plumbing supplies in case pipes freeze. One senior energy executive says: The more remote your house is, or the more essential a service your business provides, the more robust your plans for power loss should be.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2021\/may\/30\/work-is-where-your-laptop-is-meet-the-globetrotting-digital-nomads","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2021\/may\/30\/work-is-where-your-laptop-is-meet-the-globetrotting-digital-nomads","DATE":"2021-05-30 15:02:19","PLAIN_TEXT":"Samantha Scott does not miss her daily commutes in London, particularly the dread of having to wake up and get on the tube, and heading into work sweaty and flustered.

When she and her partner Chris Cerra arrive with their luggage in a new city, they can easily be mistaken for tourists. But they are part of a new generation of digital nomads who hop from country to country to live and work.

Delia Colantuono, a 31-year-old freelance translator from Rome, became a digital nomad five years ago when it was not a big thing. She has now lived on all five continents and says the nomadic lifestyle is not just for rich people - its for anyone who can work remotely and wants to do it. Many places are keen to attract long-term visitors, meaning bargains can be found.

Since he became a nomad, accommodation costs have varied from PS300 in Asia to more than PS1,000 in Stockholm, Sweden. High-speed wifi is top of the wishlist for nomads, followed by good workspace - desks or a large dining room table - a decent kitchen, and comfortable beds. Chanin Kaye, 51, and her partner Jason Melton, 46, are six months into a seven-year road trip from Mexico to Argentina, staying for about a month in each city. They decided to leave their home in Seattle because they love travelling, and to save money to pay off large student debts. Seattle has a very high cost of living, Kaye says. We had a large house with two other roommates - and we were still paying $2,400 (PS1,690) a month including utilities. Here [in Mexico] we never pay more than $1,200 all inclusive, and often less. They realised during the pandemic that they could keep in touch with their grown kids remotely and feel close even when we arent physically close. Melton left his sales job and the couple now run an accounting business remotely together that Kaye has set up. We work all day and go on adventures all weekend, she says. Kaye reckons the couple save 70% by living on the road, and wants to be debt free within five years - and buy a property somewhere eventually. Colantuono and others are aware of the environmental impact of their jetsetter lifestyle, and want to settle down eventually. Several people, writing on a Facebook digital nomads forum with 15,500 members, say age is not a barrier but stress the importance of being fit and healthy; and one says a drawback of this lifestyle might be a sense of rootlessness.

Money saving expert Martin Lewis has predicted that theres a more than 50% chance that the UK government will abandon plans to raise energy bills by 20% in April. Lewis says that, reading the runes, he thinks theres a better than 5050 chance that Jeremy Hunt will drop plans to lift the Energy Price Guarantee to PS3,000 per year, from PS2,500. Downing Street has said the plan is being kept under review, while energy secretary Grant Shapps has revealed that he is very sympathetic to calls to scrap the rise in bills. New government data has shown that the fuel poverty crisis is expected to worsen this year, after the number of families in England suffering fuel poverty rose last year. Households also face escalating price rises in the shops, with grocery inflation hitting a record 17% this month. Data firm Kantar warned that one in four families are now struggling financially, with the cost of a typical annual shop now up PS811 over the last year.

Simon Roberts says it means Sainsburys will be able to offer the same products in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK: We welcome the positive news on The Windsor Framework which will help to simplify processes and reduce friction when we move products between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This means that our customers in Northern Ireland will once again be able to access the full range of products as customers in Great Britain - and at the same great prices. 3.30pm GMT Sainsburys has now confirmed that it is proposing to close its Argos operations in Basildon, Essex and Heywood, Greater Manchester, as flagged earlier. The changes, which will affect 1,400 jobs, are part of the further integration and modernisation of Argos and Sainsburys general merchandise logistics network, it says. Staff affected by the proposals will have the opportunity to explore alternative roles within Sainsburys and Argos. It is also proposing to speng PS90m automating a depot in Daventry depot, and create a Habitat digital showroom space as part of post-pandemic property review. It plans to close its office in Milton Keynes this year, as part of its move to flexible working following the pandemic. Currently, only 11% of available desk space is regularly used by staff, it says. Simon Roberts, Sainsburys Chief Executive, says these changes will create a simpler business. As with any major change to our business, we have not taken the difficult decision to start this consultation lightly. As part of our plan to create a simpler business, we previously set out our intention to integrate our Argos and Sainsburys logistics networks. Over the last few years, weve been working hard to transform this network as we make our business simpler, more efficient and more effective for customers. This also allows us to reduce costs, so we can invest where it will make the most impact for our customers. We understand that this will be an unsettling time for affected colleagues, and we will support them however we can throughout this process. We will be consulting closely with unions and colleagues as we look to streamline the number of sites in our general merchandise logistics network. We are also announcing the significant investment were proposing to increase automation at our Daventry distribution centre. This combined with our ongoing plans to open more Local Fulfilment Centres will help us better deliver for our customers in the future. 3.13pm GMT Back in the currency markets, the pound has touched a one-month high against the euro today. Sterling is trading at EUR1.141 against the single currency, the highest level since 30 January. Simon Phillips, managing director at the travel money firm No1 Currency, says relief following yesterdays Northern Ireland Brexit deal is lifting the pound: Sterlings improved fortunes are in sharp contrast to the way it began the month, when it sank to its lowest level against the Euro in two years. The UKs deal with the EU has removed one of the most toxic - if least understood - post-Brexit sticking points, and this has reassured the currency markets and helped the Pound rally. All this is welcome news for anyone planning an Easter break in Europe, as their spending money will now go that bit further. While sterling still has a way to go to regain the ground it lost against the Dollar in February, the Pound to Euro exchange rate is the strongest it has been since January. Prime minister Rishi Sunak has been selling the Windsor Framework in Belfast, saying that Northern Ireland will be in the unbelievably special and unique position of being in both the UKs home market and the European Union Single Market.

Unite national officer Matt Draper says the union will pursue all avenues to protect jobs: Management at ArgosSainsburys has yet to provide any form of business case for the loss of these jobs. Unite will be fighting to preserve every job and will put forward an alternative business case to the company to preserve employment at these two sites. This is an incredibly wealthy company which should be investing in its loyal workforce rather than dumping workers in pursuit of short-term profits. If Sainsburys doesnt drop its closure plans then Unite will pursue all avenues to preserve employment at these sites. 2.21pm GMT Goldman Sachs boss warns of stickier inflation Over in America, the boss of Goldman Sachs has said that business leaders are a little more confident about the economic outlook. David Solomon told CNBC that the general consensus is inflation is likely to be stickier than hoped - meaning it wont fall back to 3%, or 2%, as quickly as hoped. That will mean higher interest rates for longer, and sluggish growth. But, Solomon says there is a better chance that we can muddle through with a softer landing. Theres a little more optimism, he reckons, because peoples businesses have been performing better, and consumers have been more resilient. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon says he thinks inflation will be sticky and anyone running a business has to be prepared for kind of a bumpy 12-18-24 months. https:t.coIgGyEff9Np pic.twitter.comRs6rcYwmhK&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) February 28, 2023 2.12pm GMT Downing Street has said that the plan to lift household energy bills by 20% in April are being kept under review. The prime ministers official spokesman was asked about Grant Shapps comments today (see earlier post) that he was very sympathetic to calls to scrap the increase in typical bills to PS3,000 per year in April. The PMs official spokesman said today (via PA Media): All I would say on this is its something we are just keeping under review. I dont think theres a specific time we are working to. He added: All I would emphasise is the amount of support we have already put in to support the public and businesses, paying around half of a typical households energy bill. By the end of June the energy price guarantee will have saved the typical household in Great Britain around PS1,000 since it began. 1.07pm GMT Over in parliament, Conservative MP Richard Fuller has criticised Ofgems performance in the energy crisis. Fuller told the Commons that better oversight of the energy regulator was needed, and questioned why CEO Jonathan Brearley was still in position, PA Media reports. It emerged last week that Ofgem was facing a boardroom overhaul, with ministers planning to recruit new directors to fill five of the eight seats on the board, including the role of chair. Fuller, though, says more is needed, telling MPs: Many on this side will be wondering what on earth Ofgem has been doing. It is supposed to be a regulator, it is supposed to look after consumer interests? It blunders around, it blundered around with the price cap, it blundered around with its market-entry strategy, meaning that energy companies essentially could put all of their bill payers money on red in a casino. It has ended up with billions of taxpayers money being put into bailouts. Please can we have something more than the efforts by the Government to look at new non-executive directors? Surely it is time to say, why is the chief executive remaining in post? And can we please have better oversight of this regulator and other regulators in general? They are getting away with ripping off consumers and allowing companies to do exactly the same. In response, energy Secretary Grant Shapps said he was meeting with Brearley, and such meetings would continue. He told MPs: I think its always right that we keep what our regulators do under very close watch. Shapps added: Ive called them out when Ive been concerned. I thought they had the wool being pulled over their eyes by the energy companies, and Ill continue to ensure that whatever happens will be appropriate for the future of this market. 12.45pm GMT Competition watchdog to examine home building and renting Britains competition watchdog has launched two new inquiries today, into the UKs housing crisis. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a market study into housebuilding, and will start a separate consumer protection project related to rented accommodation. The move could lead to housebuilders being forced to change their practices, or mean extra protections for tenants. The CMA is responding to widespread concerns about housing availability and costs, it says. This follows concerns that builders are not delivering enough homes, or building them fast enough to meet peoples needs. The inquiry into home building will examine four points - housing quality; land management and whether the practice of banking land is anti-competitive; local authority oversight of developers; and what factors are holding back innovation such as more sustainable, net zero homes. The CMAs work on the rental sector will examine the end-to-end experience of being a tenant in the UK, and consumer protection issues that tenants may face. Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, says the regulator will take action if it sees evidence of anti-competitive conduct: The quality and cost of housing is one of the biggest issues facing the country. Over the last few years, the CMA delivered real change for leaseholders, with tens of thousands of homeowners receiving refunds after being overcharged unfair ground rents. With that work nearly finished, were now looking to probe in more detail two further areas - the housebuilding and the rental sectors. If there are competition issues holding back housebuilding in Britain then we need to find them. But we also need to be realistic that more competition alone wont unlock a housebuilding boom. In the same vein, we want to explore the experiences people have of the rental sector and whether there are issues here that the CMA can help with. We will of course be guided by the evidence, but if we find competition or consumer protection concerns we are prepared to take the steps necessary to address them. Updated at 1.31pm GMT 12.37pm GMT Around 33,000 more civil servants in Britain, including those working for the tax office, have voted to stage a strike on Budget Day next month in a dispute over pay, pensions and job security, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has announced. They will join 100,000 civil servants across other government departments who were already scheduled to strike on 15 March. Related: 100,000 civil servants to join one-day strike action on budget day PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka said in a statement. Unless ministers put more money on the table, our strikes will continue to escalate, beginning on March 15, The PCS reballoted ten groups of members where the turnout was just below 50% in its original ballot for strike action in November. The union is holding strike action to support its campaign for a pay rise of at least 10%, pensions justice, job security and no cuts to civil service redundancy pay. 12.13pm GMT Fuel poverty crisis expected to worsen this year The number of families in England suffering fuel poverty rose last year, despite government efforts to cap bills. In 2022, there were an estimated 13.4% of households, or 3.26m, in fuel poverty in England under the Low Income Low Energy Efficiency (LILEE) metric, official figures show today. Thats up from 13.1%, or 3.16m, in 2021. Under the LILEE metric, a household is considered to be fuel poor if a) they are living in a property with a fuel poverty energy efficiency rating of band D or below, and b) spending the amount needed to heat their home would leave them with a residual income below the official poverty line. Alarmingly, the problem is expected to get worst this year - underlining the need to not raise bills in April. Todays report, from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, says: It is projected that in 2023, fuel poverty will increase to 14.4 per cent (3.53 million) with the average fuel poverty gap rising by 31 per cent in real terms to PS443 (in 2022 prices). An estimated 53.5 per cent of all low income households are projected to live in a property with a fuel poverty energy efficiency rating (FPEER) of band C or better. Additionally, the number of households who had to spend more than 10% of their income, after housing costs, on domestic energy soared last year. In 2022, 7.39 million households, or 30.3%, exceeded this threshold up from 4.93 million, or 20.5%, in 2021. A chart showing the number of UK households in fuel poverty Photograph: Department for Energy Security and Net Zero Adam Scorer, the chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, says the data does not show the full scale of the crisis. Scorer says: Over 3.2 million households in England are in fuel poverty according to Government data released today but the worst of the energy crisis is not represented - people being forced to self-disconnect, struggling with ice on the inside of their windows and living with damp and cold. And the situation will not get better. From April the average annual bill will rise from PS2,500 to PS3,000 and that means without Government intervention - both for energy efficiency measures and financial support with bills - the number in fuel poverty will continue to rise. 11.49am GMT The Scottish Government has also called for the UK Government to continue the energy price guarantee at its current rate of PS2,500 per year in April. On Monday, energy secretary Michael Matheson the cut in Ofgems price cap strengthened the case for the UK Government to reverse its plan to scrap the energy price guarantee. Matheson said yesterday: This remains an incredibly unsettling time for many thousands of households. What matters now is that the UK Government urgently re-assesses the measures it has in place which, at present, would see the average domestic bill increasing from PS2,500 to PS3,000 from April 1 at the same time as its PS400 Energy Bills Support Scheme is ended, he said. Mr Matheson said the increase will result in there being 980,000 households in Scotland in fuel poverty - an increase of 120,000. I call, once again, on the UK Government to provide additional, targeted support for vulnerable households who are struggling with their energy costs 11.35am GMT Grant Shapps very sympathetic to calls to scrap energy bills rise Interestingly, energy secretary Grant Shapps is reportedly very sympathetic to calls to protect people from a 20% rise in their energy bills in April. This adds to the pressure on the chancellor to act, given the calls from charities and from Martin Lewis to freeze the energy price guarantee at PS2,500 per year for a typical household. Speaking to The Times, Shapps said he was working very hard on the issue with Jeremy Hunt, as consumer groups and energy companies urged the government to scrap the planned increase. Shapps said: I completely recognise the argument over keeping that price guarantee in place, and the chancellor and I are working very hard on it. Im very sympathetic to making sure that we protect [people]. Were looking at this very, very carefully. More here: Grant Shapps sympathetic to calls to scrap energy bills increase This chart shows how average bills are set to jump 20% to PS3,000 in April, even though Ofgem is lowering its price cap from PS4,279 to PS3,280 (as announced yesterday). Interactive 11.14am GMT Better than 50-50 chance energy bills wont rise in April, Martin Lewis says Money saving expert Martin Lewis has predicted that theres a more than 50% chance that the UK government will abandon plans to raise energy bills in April. Lewis has been pushing for the government not to raise its Energy Price Guarantee, which caps the cost of electricity and gas, in April. As things stand, the EPG is set to rise by 20% in April, pushing a typical household bill up to PS3,000 per year, from PS2,500. Yesterday, energy regulator Ofgem cut its price cap by around PS1,000 per year, to PS3,280 - meaning bills would still be set by the EPG, as it is lower. Ofgems price cap is forecast to drop below the price guarantee in July, due to falling wholesale energy costs. [reminder, the price cap and the EPG do NOT cap the maximum bill, just the maximum cost of each unit of power]. Lewis argues that increasing prices for three months would be an act of national mental health harm. He told LBCs Tonight with Andrew Marr last night that bills are likely to fall in the summer - so it would be a mistake to hit households with higher costs until the cap is next changed in July. Lewis said: The prediction is from July the price cap will drop below the price guarantee so well start to see prices drop. That was the reason I wrote to the Chancellor three weeks ago, now supported by 85 charities. Addressing the government last night, Lewis said: Dont do it! Protect people from getting the letters, protect people from inflation going up, it is a national act of mental health harm. He argued that politically, increasing the cap is not a very clever move either... because its the government that sets prices, not the regulator, not firms, its the government. And in what would be a relief to millions of households, Lewis says he thinks theres a good chance that the Energy Price Guarantee will not be raised: Reading the runes, and Im careful with my phrasing here, I think we may get a win here. I think theres a better than 5050 chance of it not going up... Lewis also suggests the decision cant wait until the Budget, on 15th March, explaining: Because if you leave it to the budget, energy companies are obligated to write to people saying that their bills are going up 20%. &#39;Better than 50-50 chance energy bills won&#39;t rise in April&#39;, Martin Lewis says @LBC https:t.co3SABFzBZim&mdash; Will Taylor (@WillTaylor_news) February 27, 2023 Yesterday, Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, warned there would be catastrophe for millions of households if the government dropped its plan to raise the energy price guarantee to PS3,000. Dame Moriaty said: Unless the government changes course on planned reductions to the level of support for households under the Energy Price Guarantee, we estimate the number of people unable to afford their bills will double, from one in 10 to one in five. The government must keep the EPG at its current level of PS2,500. Recent drops in wholesale prices mean they have the headroom to do this. The alternative is millions more people unable to keep their house warm and keep the lights on. Updated at 11.36am GMT 10.57am GMT BP chief Bernard Looney defends companys tax bill BP chief executive Bernard Looney has said the oil and gas giant has paid its highest global tax bill in its 113 year history, in the face of calls for an extended windfall tax. Over the sounds of chanting and singing from climate protestors coming from outside the International Energy Week conference in central London, he said BP had paid $15bn tax last year, my colleague Alex Lawson reports. Looney said: Here in the UK, if we make PS4 in the North Sea, we pay PS3 in taxes. And quite frankly, the other pound is more than reinvested back into the country. So we pay our taxes - thats important that we do that.. MPs and campaigners have called for the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas firms to be toughened, to capture greater profits to hand to those struggling with bills, instead of to shareholders after BP and Shell posted record earnings in recent weeks. BP was also criticised for scaling back its climate change goals. Looney said BP was committed to pursuing low carbon projects, pledging: Net zero is a new era of opportunity for companies like ours. Looney said the company was investing $8bn in the energy transition and was rewarding millions of shareholders who relied on its dividends. He said: I there is a narrative that shareholders are somehow faceless institutions, they are far from it. Looney did not mention his own rewards, after the Sunday Times reported investor disquiet over his planned PS11m bonus.

Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, has invited representatives from the food production, manufacturing and retail sectors to Parliament today to discuss the ongoing challenges. Also hosting the meeting are Jonathan Reynolds, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Industrial Strategy and the partys Deputy Leader Angela Rayner. The party is trying to show it takes food security issues seriously after empty fruit and vegetable shelves and rationing hit the UK. Related: Vegetable shortages in UK could be tip of iceberg, says farming union McMahon has been very critical of the governments handling of the crisis, referring to environment secretary Therese Coffey as calamity Coffey and demanding she get a grip after she suggested that British people should cherish turnips during the salad crisis. He has called for her to produce an assessment of the problem in the UK, and a plan to solve the crisis. He said: Not only is turnipgate an insult to the British public, its also two fingers up to our farmers. Yesterday, farming minister Mark Spencer met with retailers. He said: I have asked retailers to look again at how they work with our farmers and how they buy fruit and vegetables, to further build preparedness for these unexpected incidents. We also welcome their commitment to working with government and farmers on longer term solutions. 10.39am GMT BoE defends delays on digital pound work Down the corridor in parliament, MPs on the Treasury committee are questioning officials from the Bank of England about its plans for a digital pound. Q: We were expecting to see your new consultation on digital currency last year - what caused the delays? BoE deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe insists that the delay in releasing the consultation paper was not due to differences of opinion with the Treasury - the cause of the delays was simply practical. He says the Banks senior leadership were very busy in September and October, when it had hoped to take the digital currency plans through governance processes. Cunliffe adds: Of course, within the Treasury, also business was a bit disrupted. [I think thats a reference to the chaos of Kwasi Kwartengs mini-budget, which his successor Jeremy Hunt unwound in Novembers autumn statement - but not before the non-digital pound had hit a record low]. Related: Pound hits all-time low against dollar after mini-budget rocks markets Q: Then we were told wed get the paper in January... Cunliffe says there was pressure of other business, and the Bank thought it was better to get the paper right than to rush it out. Q: So what were the areas of disagreement with the Treasury, and what changes were needed? Cunliffe insists there werent any disagreements, although there were some drafting changes after the document was passed around Whitehall - just pretty minor changes and nothing of substance though, he insists. That paper, incidentally, suggests the Britcoin digital pound could be in use as an alternative to cash by the end of the decade. Related: Britcoin digital currency could be in use by end of decade 10.03am GMT Food and drink manufacturers expect to keep raising their prices this year, MPs have heard this morning, which will add to grocery inflation. Caroline Keohane, head of industry growth policy at the Food and Drink Federation, has told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that food manufacturers expect to increase their selling prices by around 7% this year. This is being driven by rising input costs, which are expected to increase by 10% this year, Keohane says. These tight margins will hit producers ability to invest, she say. Those cost pressures include high energy costs - running at 22% higher than last year - and significant labour shortages. Vacancies in the sector are running at around 7%, which is double the manufacturing and UK average, Keohane explains. Poorly designed regulations are also adding to costs, Keohane says, citing the Extended Producer Responsibilities. Those regulations put the responsibility for a products end-of-life environmental impacts on producers, in an attempt to increase recycling rates. The hearing, on whether UK businesses can keep up with global competition in coming decades, is being streamed here. Updated at 10.12am GMT 9.43am GMT Credit Suisse seriously breached obligations in Greensill affair: Swiss watchdog Switzerlands financial watchdog has ruled that Credit Suisse seriously breached its supervisory obligations in connection with its business relationship with financier Lex Greensill and his companies. FINMA announced this morning that it has ordered remedial measures, after concluding that Credit Suisse had seriously breached its supervisory obligations in this context with regard to risk management and appropriate organisational structures. The regulator says: In future, the bank will have to periodically review at executive board level the most important business relationships (around 500) in particular for counterparty risks. In addition, the bank is required to record the responsibilities of its approximately 600 highest-ranking employees in a responsibility document. FINMA has also opened four enforcement proceedings against former Credit Suisse managers. In 2021, Credit Suisse suspended $10bn of investor funds after the collapse of the supply-chain lender Greensill Capital, whose loans were packaged and sold to Credit Suisse clients. Related: Crooks, kleptocrats and crises: a timeline of Credit Suisse scandals FINMA says today that the business relationship with Greensill was repeatedly discussed at Credit Suisse management level, but usually only done selectively because of a specific event or request. There was a lack of an overall view as well as regular, consistent engagement with the risks associated with Greensill at the highest level, the regulator says. Ulrich Korner, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse, says the bank welcomes the conclusion of FINMAs work. Korner says: This marks an important step towards the final resolution of the SCFF issue. FINMAs review has reinforced many of the findings of the Board-initiated independent review and underlines the importance of the actions we have taken in recent years to strengthen our Risk and Compliance culture. We also continue to focus on maximizing recovery for fund investors. Korner adds that since March 2021 (when Greensill Capital filed for insolvency), Credit Suisse has taken action to directly address many of the issues subsequently highlighted by FINMA. 9.31am GMT Members of the GMB union on the picket line outside the Amazon fulfilment centre in Coventry today Photograph: Phil BarnettPA Elsewhere in the retail sector, union members at an Amazon distribution centre in Coventry have begun a second day of industrial action. More than 310 Amazon staff at its giant fulfilment centre in the West Midlands city are striking today, and will also strike on 2 March and from 13 to 17 March, in an ongoing pay dispute. In January, workers at the Coventry warehouse became the first in the UK to take strike action against the online retail giant. As well as seeking higher pay, they have also complained of overbearing management practices and long hours.

The countrys gloomy economic outlook is likely to weigh on the housing market this year, with Travis Perkins warning that there is macroeconomic uncertainty. Reuters has the details: Travis Perkins, which sells bricks, timber and new kitchens, as well as equipment for large construction projects, said adjusted operating profit fell 16% last year to PS295m, behind a consensus forecast of PS320m pounds. The miss was blamed on restructuring costs from closing 20 smaller branches out of the groups 1,500, which Chief Financial Officer Alan Williams said was part of Travis Perkins plan to prepare for a tougher year. 9.14am GMT The surge in grocery inflation to record levels is adding to the pressure on Ocado, says Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Lund-Yates points out that despite a 13% increase in active customers last year, volumes havent followed suit, meaning the cost to serve all those online orders has become a burden. Ocado is in the eye of the cost-of-living storm because its offering isnt synonymous with being the best value, its a higher-end option, without the same benefits of enticing people in with tangible, physical goods like M&amp;S or Waitrose can. One quarter of British shoppers are struggling as grocery price inflation goes above 17% for the first time, according to new data from Kantar. It was a year ago that food inflation climbed above 4%, meaning consumers now feel like theres a hole in their wallet every time they reach the checkout. 8.56am GMT If you were ill this month, you werent alone. February also saw sales of cold treatments rising by 82%, cough liquids up 78% and cough lozenges 70% higher, Kantar reports. 8.52am GMT Aldi and Lidl grow market share Sales at discount supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl both rose this month, as UK shoppers tried to cut their grocery bills. Aldis market share rose to a new record, of 9.4% this month, and remains the fastest growing grocer, with sales up by 26.7%. It was closely followed by Lidl which increased sales by 25.4%, growing its market share to 7.1%. Frozen food specialist Iceland also won share, taking 2.4% of market sales, up from 2.3% last year as spending through its tills increased by 10.8%. Kantar also reports that Ocado put in a strong performance, bucking the overall trend in online sales. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight, says: While online fell by 0.9% over the 12 weeks, the digital specialist [Ocado] grew sales by 11.3% to achieve its largest ever market share of 1.9%. Tesco edged slightly ahead in the battle between Britains biggest retailers, with sales up by 6.6%. Sainsburys and Asda were just behind with sales rising by 6.2% and 5.9% respectively. Morrisons sales decline of 0.9% was its best performance since May 2021. Waitrose returned to growth, nudging up sales by 0.7%. It has a market share of 4.7%. Convenience retailer Co-op increased sales by 3.4% while independents and symbols were up by 1.8%. Updated at 8.59am GMT 8.41am GMT Demand for supermarket own label ranges has swelled over the last year, Kantar reports. Sales of these lines are up by 13.2% this month, well ahead of branded products at 4.6%, and this trend shows little sign of stopping, Kantars Fraser McKevitt explains. 8.34am GMT One quarter of British shoppers struggling as grocery price inflation hits 17% Supermarket inflation has hit a new record high this month, with prices climbing by more than 17% in the year to February. Data provider Kantar reports that grocery price inflation rose to 17.1% in the four weeks to 19 February. This means that households face spending an extra PS811 on their annual supermarket bills, unless they change their shopping habits. This is the highest level of grocery inflation Kantar has ever recorded, and shows that the pressures on food shoppers are intensifying this year. One in four shoppers are now struggling financially, they warn. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says: Shoppers have been facing sustained price rises for some time now and this February marks a full year since monthly grocery inflation climbed above 4%. This is having a big impact on peoples lives. Kantars latest research shows that grocery price inflation is the second most important financial issue for the public behind energy costs, with two-thirds of people concerned by food and drink prices, above public sector strikes and climate change. The report shows that more households are being dragged into the cost of living crisis. squeeze. McKevitt says: One quarter say theyre struggling financially, versus one in five this time last year. The numbers speak for themselves. If people dont change how they buy their groceries, households are facing an PS811 increase to their average annual bill. However, cost-of-living pressures failed to dent enthusiasm for Valentines Day celebrations this year. Sales of steak up by a quarter in the seven days to February 14 compared to the previous week, sparkling wine sales doubling and shoppers spending an extra PS5m on boxed chocolates. Updated at 8.58am GMT 8.26am GMT Reuters: UK home prices to fall, but unlikely to come crashing down British home prices will fall less than previously expected in 2023, a new poll of analysts has found. After years of bumper price rises, the average cost of a home will fall 2.4% this year, according to a poll of 19 housing market experts conducted by Reuters in February has found. Thats shallower than the 4.7% fall predicted in a November poll. This months survey found that house prices are expected to rise by 1.0% next year on average and 3.5% in 2025. Aneisha Beveridge at estate agency Hamptons predicts: Its likely 2023 will be a year of transition as buyers and sellers adapt to a new era of higher interest rates before the market returns to growth again in 2024. Higher borrowing costs will weigh on the housing markets this year. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates in March, to 4.25%, with rates currently seen approaching 5% by the end of this year.

Daly says Ocado is approaching a tipping point: While the pandemic prompted a jump in demand for online groceries, a return to in-store shopping and the cost-of-living crisis is affecting consumer spending habits. With competitors such as Tesco increasingly matching the discounts offered by budget supermarkets, Ocado is approaching a tipping point where it must decide how to position itself. There are testing times ahead for the supermarket industry, with those companies at the top of the market especially vulnerable to price squeezes. Now, its essential Ocado defines its target market, creating coherent, clear messaging that stands out in the competitive market. 8.16am GMT Ocado shares drop 9% Shares in Ocado have dropped by over 9% at the start of trading in London, the top faller on the FTSE 100 index. They fell as low as 563p, down from over PS13 a year ago. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says Ocado is caught between a rock and a hard place. Thats because the two elements of its business - its technology solutions arm, and the Retail division - continue to face different tests, Hunter explains: The Solutions business, on which most of the groups hopes for future growth and profitability is pinned, has yet to deliver on a sufficient scale to appease investors. The promises of large-scale adoption for its cutting-edge technology has yet to fully materialise, after some considerable time, which has led to investors shunning the stock in their droves. Over the last two years, the share price has fallen by 72%. Yet progress is evident in this part of the business. UK solutions revenue grew by 13% to PS802.7 million over the period, while the International unit saw revenues spike by 122% to PS148 million. The latter continues to run at a loss, however, leading the group to attempt to accelerate the rollout of its Ocado Smart Platform to partners. Over the last year, 12 new sites were opened, with 23 now live split between 12 overseas and 11 in the UK. Further deals were signed, most notably with Lotte Shopping of South Korea, and Ocado maintains that the new partner pipeline is strong and that further OSP deals are being sought. For the Retail business, from which the vast majority of revenues are currently derived, the environment is getting tougher. The so-called Covid unwind has had an impact as shopping habits normalise, while given some UK economic hardship, customers have begun to seek cheaper product offerings elsewhere. It is also evident that while customers are still coming to Ocado, it tends to be more selective. As such, even though active customers rose by 13% to 940000, average basket sizes falling from PS129 to PS118, leaving the Retail part of the business with a 3.8% decline in revenues to PS2.2 billion, marginally shy of expectations. 8.05am GMT Abrdn hit by one of toughest years in living memory Stock market turbulence has hit earnings at Abrdn, the global investment company.

Shares have jumped 4% in early trading. 8.03am GMT Ocados push to sell its technology to grocery retailers around the world should help it turn its fortunes around, predicts Jocelyn Paulley, retail partner at law firm Gowling WLG: As Ocado has been experiencing difficulties since the end of the pandemic when demand for its delivery service dropped, this update will be welcome news to investors but they will be wary of a challenging period ahead as shoppers tighten their belts amidst economic uncertainty and increased energy costs eat into the companys margins. However, the food retailer is actively seeking to be a technology partner for other supermarket chains internationally, and if it is able to secure a number of contracts in this area, then this is likely to contribute to a turnaround for the business. Ocado struck two new international partnerships last year, with Lotte Shopping in South Korea and Auchan Polska in Poland, to jointly build warehouses.

Halifaxs data showed that the average UK house price went up by 20.4% - or PS48,620 - between January 2020 and December 2022, climbing from PS237,895 to PS286,515. Owners of larger homes have been the big winners from the pandemic-fuelled race for space, while London flat owners have gained the least. My colleague Rupert Jones explains: According to the 2020-22 data, the average price for bigger homes grew at almost twice the rate than for smaller properties. When the UK housing market first reopened after months of Covid lockdown, there was an increase in demand for larger homes as buyers sought more space, a garden or better environments for working from home. As a result, the average price of a detached home soared by 25.9% between the start of 2020 and the end of 2022.

Ocado, the online grocery and technology firm, has posted a PS500m loss for last year as the cost of living crisis hits spending. 2022 was a challenging year for Ocado Retail, the company tells shareholders this morning, reporting that pre-tax losses widened to PS500.8m for last year, up from PS176.9m in 2021. That compared to analysts average forecast of a loss of 399 million pounds, Reuters reports. Revenues at Ocado Retail, its joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer, fell by 3.8% during the year, despite the company reporting record sales over Christmas. Related: Ocado has record Christmas sales but people are buying fewer items Ocado Retail did swell its customer base, though - active customers increased by 13% to 940,000. One challenge is that Ocado Retail customers are putting fewer items in their baskets in response to higher prices and the cost of living crisis. Soaring costs, and the unwinding of the spending boost during pandemic lockdowns, are also biting. Tim Steiner, Ocados CEO, says every company has had its business model tested by a combination of macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds. Ocado has more confidence in its model than ever before, he declares. Steiner tells the City: Ocado Retail, our UK JV with M&amp;S, has shown its resilience against a backdrop of higher costs and smaller baskets, reflecting the Covid unwind and the UK cost of living crisis, by growing customer numbers and increasing online market share. As the Covid unwind fades and customer growth continues the business will start to recover the fixed costs of recent capacity commitments. Ocados business also builds robots and software for online grocery deliveries. The company says that its partners have reported leading customer satisfaction metrics and growth ahead of the broader online channel in their respective markets. Also coming up today As the UK housing market cools, home sellers are accepting an average discount of 4.5% off their asking prices to find a buyer, property website Zoopla reports this morning. The average property price in the UK is now PS260,800, Zoopla said, which means sellers are taking a cut of PS14,100. It is the highest gap between the asking price and sale price for five years, according to Zoopla, and follows several months of falling house prices. The average discount to asking price was 4.5% this month, the biggest discount in more than five years and up from 0.4% in 2022, according to Zoopla(via bbg) pic.twitter.comu7nJ5jf3Sn&mdash; Michael Brown (@MrMBrown) February 28, 2023 But, the surge in house prices since the start of the pandemic means sellers have flexibility to accept lower offers, as Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, explains: Greater realism on the part of sellers is supporting housing market activity in the face of higher borrowing costs. Many homeowners are sitting on sizable house price gains made over recent years and have more room to be flexible accepting offers below the asking price. Discounts to asking price have widened and while 4-5% discounts are manageable, if these were to widen further then this would point to a greater likelihood of larger house price falls. We believe the market remains on track for a soft landing in 2023 with modest price falls of up to 5% and one million housing sales.

Traditionally, more women than men - particularly those with children or caring responsibilities - have requested flexible working. The switch to working from home necessitated by coronavirus lockdowns has, 15 months on, resulted in a permanent change in corporate culture, to the extent that the government is considering legislating to make home working the default option. During Covid, millions of previously office-based employees enjoyed more family time and tasted life without the commute. Earlier in the pandemic, there were hopes that the wider adoption of remote working might remove the gender divide, while also reducing the so-called maternity penalty and getting rid of a culture of presenteeism. Yet employment experts are warning that the hybrid working model favoured by most large businesses and organisations, allowing staff to split their time between home and their desks, could have unintended consequences for gender equality. Employers now see that employees dont have to show face time, said Professor Cary Cooper, a psychologist from Alliance Manchester Business School. The big question we dont have the answer to is, during this 15-month period, have enough men said to themselves life isnt just about work. Did they begin to reprioritise and understand how important the family is? Cooper, who is also president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, believes wider take-up of flexible working by men would alleviate gender inequality in the post-Covid workplace. If they dont, then we have a problem, as women will be working substantially from home and the men will go in more days a week than the women, and that will adversely affect their career. On Friday, the accountancy firm Deloitte became the latest large office-occupier to embrace an ultra-flexible future, telling its 20,000 UK employees they can decide when to visit the office. Leaving the choice of workplace entirely in the hands of staff is a worry for Joeli Brearley, founder of the charity Pregnant Then Screwed, which supports women facing maternity or pregnancy discrimination. Those with caring responsibilities or with disabilities will tend to stay at home and other employees will likely go into the office, she said. Deloitte has told staff they can decide when to visit the office. Photograph: Hannah McKayReuters Those at home will look like theyre less committed to their job, they wont have as a good a relationship with their manager, the person that can promote them and give them a pay rise, Brearley said. Jane* works in a managerial role in the hospitality sector in London, and requested a permanent move to remote working for part of the week, after successfully working from home during lockdown. However, the mother-of-one believes her flexible working arrangement has already scuppered a promotion. I can show the results of my work, but it seems to be forgotten because Im not there five days a week, Jane said. Its that old-school mentality, that it doesnt matter what you do as long as youre in the office. Since returning from maternity leave last summer, Siobhan*, who works in operations for a small company in the East Midlands, has occasionally worked from home because of a lack of childcare during the pandemic. Without any discussion, some of her responsibilities have been removed. I feel like Ive been demoted, Siobhan said. Its not a reflection on the quality of my work. There hasnt been much support. Most employment experts agree that organisations will have to monitor closely how new working policies are adopted by staff once coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Companies have to take this seriously and build a cultural model in their organisation, said Katy Fridman, founder of talent platform Flexible Working People. The onus is on the employer. There has to be encouragement across the board [for flexible working] from seniority to entry-level staff and whatever gender, so there isnt a disparity, or this could very well set women back. Related: Workers must be given right to do jobs from home, says Labour Women were more likely than men to reduce their flexible working demands to align with the perceived expectations of their manager or employer, according to a recent study by psychologists at the Behavioural Insights Team, the so-called nudge unit, which works with government. If we really care about diversity and inclusion, the study shows there is difference, regardless of the reason behind it, said Hannah Burd, principal adviser at the team. We really encourage employers, whatever policy decision they make, to monitor the impact, and see if they do need to adjust it, to ensure women, or junior people, are getting more access to opportunities. * Not her real name","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"environment\/2022\/may\/31\/bernard-heath-obituary","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2022\/may\/31\/bernard-heath-obituary","DATE":"2022-05-31 16:27:38","PLAIN_TEXT":"In 1965, Bernard Heath pushed open the rattly door of a former shepherds cottage deep in the Galloway Hills in southern Scotland, and thumbed open the visitor book. He was attracted to an entry expressing dismay at the abandonment and likely ruination of many worthy buildings in remote countryside and the hope that an organisation could take this sad state of affairs in hand. Bernard took this to heart and was determined to act. He was familiar with staying in bothies not least because so-called mobile camping was a cumbersome and heavyweight affair. Small buildings constructed from combinations of stone, wood, metal sheeting - whatever was locally available - they housed shepherds, gamekeepers, miners and the like whose work took them far from towns and villages. Bernard Heath on his bicycle - he was a pioneer of adventurous off-road cycling. Photograph: Denis Mollison With imagination, determination and energy - which would become his familiar modus operandi - in the summer of that year he organised a team to restore the ruin of Tunskeen in Galloway. From this emerged the Mountain Bothies Association and, for years, Bernard, who has died aged 93, was the driving force behind it. As the organisation grew, now with about 4,000 members, it became familiar with the very tricky building challenges set by isolation, foot-slogging by broken tracks, and the often inclement British weather; but Bernard was able to conjure up a positive attitude that defied the apparently impossible. Right from the beginning he asserted that no problem was insurmountable, even if it might require some creative thinking. And so, as he described work at Tunskeen, with his team member Brian Bunyan: We stuffed some concrete into that wall and lots of old fence irons, wire and old bed frames. Higher up we found our home-made Heath-Bunyan scaffolding was a bit stretched so we built one bed frame into the gable end to stand on and reached with ease the apex at what seemed a dizzy height at the time. Bernard was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, the younger son of Joseph Heath, an engineers tool inspector, and his wife, Jessie (nee Fuller), a tailor. Leaving school at 16, and following national service in the Royal Navy, he qualified as a chartered management accountant and taught accountancy at technical colleges first in Huddersfield and later in Thurso. He had a love of cycling that lasted all his life. In helping to establish the Huddersfield Star Wheelers and then the Rough Stuff Fellowship, Bernard moved from being a member of a rather conventional cycling club to a pioneer of very adventurous off-road cycling in isolated wild country. The bothy at Tunskeen in the Galloway hills in the 1960s, soon after Bernard Heath found it and began repairs. Photograph: MBA Archives For 10 years his annual holiday was spent with a close friend, Frank Goodwin, exploring remote corners of upland Britain. No Scottish Highland glen seemed outside their ambition, pushing and carrying their bikes over high passes and fishing from mountain lochs to supplement their provisions. He took several trips abroad, most notably making the first cycle crossing of the interior of Iceland in 1958. At the inaugural meeting of the association he met Betty Taylor, and they married in 1970. They were affectionately referred to as B&amp;B, and were well matched for enthusiasm, hard work, modesty and openness. The bothy at Tunskeen in its restored state in August 2004. Photograph: MBA Archives Bernard worked easily by minimum impact principles in which he was again a pioneer. Only existing buildings - part of the human history of the landscape - were identified to become one of the mountain bothies, after which the landowner would be asked for permission for its use for an undefined period of time with property rights remaining unchanged. Bernards success in establishing good relationships reflects his positive view of human nature and his basic trust in people. Anyone is free to use the unlocked buildings whether they are MBA members or not; and with the great expansion of outdoor recreation allied to an information revolution, it is to the credit of Bernard that he established a system that assumes the essential trustworthiness of bothiers and which enables the association to maintain some 105 unlocked buildings. In the late 1970s Bernard gave up his teaching job so that he and Betty could start a metal recycling business and smallholding at their home in Thurso, which they ran successfully for 20 years. They still had energy to engage with local conservation issues and to plant a mixed woodland which was handed over to the Dunnet Forest Trust. Bernard Heath and his wife, Betty, who matched him in enthusiasm and hard work. They were known affectionately as B&amp;B. Photograph: Denis Mollison Success in attracting help, especially from volunteers with professional skills, meant they could pull back from direct involvement in work parties, but well into their 80s they both maintained an involvement with the MBA at many levels. In 1991, shortly after its 25th anniversary, Bernard and Betty received the unusual recognition of both being awarded the British Empire Medal. Possessed of curiosity and imagination, they could never resist the pull to see whats up the glen and over the hill, perhaps best illustrated in their exploration of small uninhabited islands. At the age of 74 Bernard fulfilled a long held ambition to cycle from Lands End to John OGroats, characteristically spinning out the route to over 1,500 miles along byways and off-road tracks. Two years later a stroke brought a gradual slowdown to his activities while still working on bothy projects into his 80s. Likewise Betty continued to be very active into old age, and at the age of 86 was going backpacking on her own in the wilds near Cape Wrath. A friend remembers meeting them on their way to a bothy in about 2010, with Betty carrying a folding metal bed tied to her wooden pack-frame: We stopped for a quick chat. Isnt that bed awfully heavy? the friend asked. Lets just say the one I carried in yesterday was lighter, she replied. Betty died last year. Bernard is survived by two nephews, James and Anthony. * Bernard Joseph Heath, founder of the Mountain Bothies Association, born 22 September 1928; died 31 March 2022","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/aug\/28\/councils-england-wales-pay-1m-pounds-a-year-to-house-child-in-private-care-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/aug\/28\/councils-england-wales-pay-1m-pounds-a-year-to-house-child-in-private-care-home","DATE":"2022-08-28 08:48:30","PLAIN_TEXT":"More than 20 councils in England and Wales have paid the equivalent of PS1m a year or more to place a single child in a private childrens home as the cost of specialised care soars, data released to the Guardian shows. The body representing childrens services directors in England urged the government to take profit out of childrens social care as figures showed 24 councils were paying the equivalent of seven-figure sums. One local authority - Knowsley in Merseyside - paid PS49,680 a week for one child, which would equate to more than PS2m a year. Steve Crocker, the president of the Association of Directors of Childrens Services (ADCS) in England, said the Guardians findings highlighted an increasing problem. Childrens needs vary and we recognise that some placements, for example for children with complex and overlapping education, health and social care needs, will cost more than others. However, profiteering is a growing concern for us, and the Competition and Markets Authority recently expressed similar concerns following a market study in childrens social care, he said. ADCS members continue to call for a shift towards a not-for-profit system, both Scottish and Welsh governments are working towards this goal, but we are realistic, this cannot happen overnight. Plus, an outright ban on profits comes with the risk of disorderly withdrawals from the market, the stakes are just too high for children. So, whilst we should work towards a not-for-profit system, all other options should be explored in the meantime. Dame Rachel de Souza, the childrens commissioner for England, said the most expensive placements tended to be short-term and bespoke, with high numbers of agency staff and high staff-to-child ratios. This is the opposite of the stable, loving and specialist care that we need to be providing for all our children, she said, calling for a radically different approach which refocuses on the principle that children should be cared for close to home, in placements that adapt as childrens needs change. There is no data to suggest that the most expensive placements have the best outcomes for children. But the extreme costs involved in taking care of a very small number of young people is a huge challenge for cash-strapped councils, which often end up cutting preventive services. The most costly placements were to look after some of societys most vulnerable children, often at very short notice. Some were as young as 12 and needed four staff watching them 24 hours a day. Many had issues of serious self-harm and of hurting their carers, and in some cases a judge had authorised for them to be locked up in a secure home. These children, deemed a risk to themselves and others, qualify for places in secure childrens homes, all run by the state or voluntary sector. But there are now only 14 of these specialist therapeutic institutions in England and Wales, not nearly enough to match the need. On any given day, approximately 50 children are waiting for a place, according to Ofsted, the inspectorate. Children who cannot find a place in a secure childrens home are usually detained elsewhere, often in flats or other accommodation with large teams of agency staff. Since last autumn, North Yorkshire county council has been spending PS35,480 a week on the care of one child, who is watched constantly by three agency staff and one dedicated support worker. Hammersmith and Fulham in London paid PS42,000 for one week for a child who was unable to be safely placed alongside other children, while Lewisham in London paid PS23,000 a week for 17 months for a teenager who needed a mental health nurse, three care support workers during the day and two care support workers at night. Blackpool council paid between PS24,000 and PS31,000 a week for one childs care over a three-month period. That young person was vulnerable to sexual exploitation and was subject to a deprivation of liberty order and care order imposed by a high court judge. About 35 English children are living in Scottish secure homes, far from friends and family, Ofsted said. In Scotland - where a third of all childrens homes are run by private providers, compared with more than three-quarters in England and Wales - councils are generally paying far less than their English and Welsh counterparts. Only seven have crossed the PS10,000 a week threshold, with the most expensive for a non-disabled child costing PS10,700 weekly (North Ayrshire). Between 2016 and 2020, the number of looked-after children rose 14% in England, and 27% in Wales, though it fell by 7% in Scotland. Ofsted said: The childrens social care market remains problematic. Commissioning of specialist services is often linked to individual children ... A national approach to commissioning these specialist services is necessary and long overdue. Average prices for childrens home places in England are PS4,865 a week for a local authority place and PS4,153 for a private placement, a review by the Personal Social Services Review Unit found. This is up from about PS3,000 in 2016, with prices rising week by week as the cost of food, petrol and energy spirals. But now many English and Welsh councils are regularly paying more than PS10,000 a week per child. Devon county council said it had commissioned 43 PS10,000-plus weekly placements since 2018. Lancashire county council and Tameside in Greater Manchester have each had 28 in the same time period. Councils that have paid the equivalent of PS1m a year or more (PS19,600-plus per week) for one childs residential care are: Devon, Knowsley, North Yorkshire, Nottingham, Blackpool, Coventry, Hampshire, Suffolk, Barnsley, Norfolk, Thurrock, Blackburn with Darwen, Wokingham, Nottinghamshire, East Sussex, Warrington; the London boroughs of Brent, Hackney, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Hillingdon, Lewisham and Sutton; and Monmouthshire and Powys in Wales. Interactive Five local authorities - Sefton in Merseyside, Swansea and Wrexham in Wales and Wolverhampton and Walsall in the Midlands - refused to reveal the cost of their most expensive childrens home placement, saying to do so could risk revealing the identity of a child. The Guardian has complained to the information commissioner, but the process tends to take at least nine months. A Department for Education spokesperson said: All children and young people deserve to grow up in a stable, loving home, and no private company should exploit those in need of placement. Childrens homes care for young people who often have very complex needs, requiring dedicated - and sometimes constant round the clock - support. Thats why we are putting unprecedented investment into expanding provision and raising standards for children in care, ahead of wide-scale reform to the care system.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/jul\/13\/the-east-end-care-home-where-covid-was-at-its-most-lethal","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/jul\/13\/the-east-end-care-home-where-covid-was-at-its-most-lethal","DATE":"2022-07-13 13:54:45","PLAIN_TEXT":"It was like I had been hit by a truck, said Lauren Turrell, thinking back to over two years ago. On 4 April 2020, her grandmother Irene Penton died in a Covid-ravaged care home in Londons East End. With Covids first wave rising to its peak, Penton became one of the first of at least 21 residents in Aspen Court to perish in under a month. Like many of the residents of the purpose-built home in Poplar, Irene, 92, had dementia. She had spent her lifetime in the East End and had survived the blitz but could not avoid Covid. As the UKs Covid death toll surpasses 200,000, families of Aspen Court residents have recalled how their loved ones were swept away in those first weeks. What happened there was a microcosm of a nationwide trauma that thousands of families are still struggling with today. As lockdown began, Irene Penton had been doing fine. Then her family received a call from the care staff to say its not long now. Fifteen minutes later, Penton, who in happier times had treated Lauren to the amusement arcades in Clacton-on-Sea and taught her to crochet, was dead. In a matter of weeks the virus also claimed the lives of Maureen Nottage, 86, a local school cleaner who loved Only Fools and Horses, Robert Henry, 78, who worked on the refurbishment of the fire-damaged Windsor Castle, two ladies - Betty and Mary - known to visitors only by their first names, a mother-of-four who emigrated to Britain from Jamaica in the 1950s and Shirley Locke, 84, who used to clean the cells at Bethnal Green police station. Locke was one of six residents discharged back into the home from the Royal London hospital, not all of whom were tested. Aspen Court entered the pandemic under a cloud. It was, and is, owned by HC-One, which operates 340 care homes in a chain founded in 2011 from the collapse of Southern Cross. The private equity-owned group paid out close to PS50m in dividends in the years preceding the pandemic, despite declaring losses. In November 2019, the Care Quality Commission judged the home requires improvement with the worst scores for safety and leadership. Jodhi Wright said she would find her grandfather Donald left in his bed in soiled adult nappies, his bed soaked with urine. She watched staff working while listening to music on headphones and leaving residents completely unattended in the lounge. They got him out of the home in September 2019. I am really not surprised [21 people died from Covid], she said. I know how they were treating their residents pre-Covid. They werent treated with respect or dignity. To Irene Pentons family, Aspen Court seemed shabby. They also worried there were few, if any staff, keeping an eye on residents in the lounge. Staff can be run off their feet, one relative told inspectors. Irenes daughter, Sheila Jones, saw residents struggling to get out of wheelchairs when they should have been helped and carers saying they were too busy to take people to the toilet. They were just put in the day room, shoved in armchairs and thats where they would stay until they were put to bed, she said. My mum would say she was very unhappy. Maureen Nottage, who lived almost all of her life in Bethnal Green, and had dementia, would plead with staff for incontinence pads. She was a dignified woman and would have been mortified if they knew she was wetting herself, her family said. After she died they found notes she would write to staff. One read: Sorry Miss, got no pads, sat up all night, please dont have a go at me, I am already afraid. It was a sad contrast to happier times. Her family was her life and we would constantly visit, which kept us together, said her daughter Kim. Then came Covid, seeded perhaps from hospitals, perhaps by staff or visitors. The risk to care home residents was quickly apparent. On 13 March 2020 Sir Patrick Vallance, the governments chief scientific adviser, said asymptomatic transmission of the virus looks quite likely and three days later Disability Rights UK warned the then care minister Helen Whately that care homes were lacking realistic, meaningful advice on how to protect their vulnerable residents. Twenty-four hours later, the NHS and Department of Health ordered the urgent discharge of medically fit patients into care homes, as part of a push to free up 30,000 hospital beds because of fears the NHS would be overwhelmed. A battle between the interests of the NHS and social care was under way inside Whitehall. Discharged patients were not being tested and some care homes resisted. The Royal London hospital said it discharged six people into Aspen Court in March and April, some untested. Despite fears about the spread of the virus to the most vulnerable, the Department of Health, eager to free up hospital beds, argued restrictions could be seen to frighten care homes and reduce much needed capacity.According to internal correspondence disclosed in Aprils successful high court challenge to the discharge policy, Whately asked: Why are we not planning to test patients for discharge to the care sector? This would make such a difference. She added: This is written like the NHS is divine and care homes are slaves.The NHS side won. Guidance was published on 2 April stating negative tests were not required and anyone without symptoms should be cared for as normal with staff only to wear PPE with residents with symptoms or confirmed cases of Covid. There was no block on visiting.Inside Aspen Court, residents had already started to die from Covid, with the first fatality on 28 March, local authority records show.On 1 April, HC-Ones head office in Darlington wrote to relatives with news of a difficult situation: 10 Aspen Court residents had suspected Covid. On 4 April Lauren Turrells grandmother Irene Penton, who had Alzheimers but was otherwise in stable health, deteriorated fast. Her temperature spiked, her oxygen level fell and she was really struggling, a care worker told Laurens stunned mother, Sheila, by phone. Sheila gathered herself and called back about 15 minutes later to ask about sending a doctor, but it was already too late. No one knew for sure if Covid had killed her, but her family suspected it had. Dr Osman Ali, a GP to many of the residents, had received only four tests for the whole home, which had 68 residents before Covid. Maureen Nottages Covid symptoms began on 26 March. She was prescribed antibiotics and inhalers but died alone in her room on 7 April. Her family complained they should have been allowed in to see her and claimed the home had downplayed her condition in phone calls in the days before she died. Kim Nottage, Maureens daughter, said that when she went into the home after her mother died she noticed PPE was not being used properly.It is possible that improper use of PPE contributed to a spread of the virus in Aspen Court, concluded a council report a year later. The approach to PPE seemed odd to Kim, a school administrator, who was being careful to undress and shower as soon as she arrived home from work as a precaution. Robert Henry. Photograph: Amanda Henry Amanda Henry went into the home to see her father, Robert Henry, 78, before he succumbed to Covid on 8 April - four days after a call from the home to say he had a cough. It was a sudden end to a vibrant life. Amandas pictures of him show him cavorting in various types of fancy dress from a tam-o-shanter to a Borat mankini. Inside the home, staff were facing immense pressures. As she sat, holding her fathers hand, Amanda noticed the nurses and carers coming and going through his room werent changing their PPE, she said. Some were agency workers and said they had also been working in another care home where there was a Covid outbreak. One came in to give her father personal care with his mask untied at the bottom. He had no gloves on, she said. He didnt wash his hands or sanitise.The manager and deputy manager of the care home were by now off sick and HC-One sent in a regional manager to take over. Staff were scared but brave, said Sister Christine Frost, a Catholic nun who had been a regular visitor to the home. For them it was dreadful, she said. They werent getting the PPE equipment ... and they were afraid for their own health. They were very sad for the people dying and the families [who] couldnt come in.Months later concerns were raised at the council about the need for mental health support for care workers especially at Aspen Court after the impact of [the] number of deaths over such a short time period.With the virus rampant and residents confined to their rooms, the atmosphere in the home changed. It was understaffed, agency workers were unfamiliar with residents and staff who were usually chatty were quiet, Amanda recalled.On 8 April her father lay slumped semi-conscious. He needed a saline drip, which the home couldnt provide. Amanda wanted him to be taken to hospital but the nursing staff insisted he had to remain in the home according to protocol, according to a subsequent official report. Upset but assured the staff they would check on him every 15 minutes, Amanda went home. In bed, before 11pm, they called her back. She rushed to Aspen Court but it was too late. In the hallway, before she could reach him, a nurse told her he had died. When she saw her father she burst into tears. A relative of another resident, in her 90s, who died about this time said she believed isolation and neglect had led to her death while the home was locked down. She and other family members used to visit her several times a week, bringing her drinks and biscuits. The viruss progress through the residents of Aspen Court outpaced policymakers. By 24 April, 21 residents had died with Covid - more than the boroughs four other care homes combined. It was only on 15 April that the government decided all care home residents must be tested before admission. Related: Finally, this reckless government faces a reckoning for Covid deaths in care homes | Charlie Williams The London borough of Tower Hamlets established a bronze command to coordinate support for care homes on 27 April. A day later the health secretary, Matt Hancock, offered a Covid test to every care worker and resident in England. It wasnt until May 2020 that ministers launched a PS600m fund to limit staff movements and provide full pay for isolating care workers. A spokesperson for HC-One said the pandemic has been an exceptionally difficult time for everyone connected to our homes. We have worked very hard to protect our residents and colleagues, and we have always strived to take all possible precautions to keep [them] safe, the spokesperson said. When little was known about the virus, HC-One published daily case numbers and death figures for its homes, and engaged at length and in detail with health and care officials, our families, and the media during what was a rapidly changing landscape. Asked about Jodhi Wrights complaints about the treatment of her grandfather, a spokesperson said the home was radically different today. We are sorry for any upset and shortcomings they may have experienced in 2019, they said. A lot has changed at Aspen Court over the past three years to ensure we are providing the kind and good care all our residents deserve.At 7.30am on 8 May, Irene Penton was cremated alone without a single friend or relative in attendance. At the allotted time Lauren picked forget-me-nots, arranged them in a vase at home, lit a candle and called her mum and aunt on the phone. There wasnt much they could say after everything they had been through. Lauren recalled: We were just silent.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2023\/feb\/17\/uk-housing-association-clarion-home-owners-renters","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/feb\/17\/uk-housing-association-clarion-home-owners-renters","DATE":"2023-02-17 06:00:02","PLAIN_TEXT":"You will read the grim facts about Chanel Sultans life in a minute, but first lets talk about her dreams. Like the law degree she has just started, or her hope to buy her own home. Like her years spent driving buses by day and working on her construction business in the evenings, all to feed her three children. Like reading self-help books and doing penance at the gym. We can live lives that we really want to live, she says. Not the ones weve been given. We sit in a house so run-down it laughs at any dreams, and I cant tell whether such faith is born of determination or delusion. At night she can hear rats scratching around beneath the floorboards under her bed. She and her children have seen them scuttling about and found their rotting corpses, have even had their belongings chewed up. Over the few months they have lived in this Victorian terrace, the ferocious damp and mould have ruined their clothes and their furniture. The headboard and base of Sultans own bed are so spoilt that they have been thrown away. In her bedroom, the mattress now sits atop cardboard packing boxes. For the past few months, I have been talking with Sultan about this home that feels anything but homely. Ive seen dozens of photos and videos of what she found on moving in last summer: exterior doors that didnt lock, electric wiring exposed, rat droppings everywhere and a toilet bowl encrusted with faeces. And Ive read emails and letters and all the back-and-forth as shes tried to get things fixed. With only partial success: visiting last week, I saw the damp on the walls, the plugged up rat holes, and, in the garden, the big black traps warning of poison inside. This squalor was supposed to be her fresh start. After some hard years, the 38-year-old had just got remarried and fancied a new life in the suburbs of London. On viewing, shed had some worries, but the family say they were assured that central heating and double glazing would arrive at the property before they did. They were even asked to pick a colour for the new door. And since those promises came from the countrys biggest housing association, Clarion, Sultan believed them. Bad move. Not only were the works not done before they moved in, but the previous resident left behind decades worth of belongings. More extraordinary still was Clarions response. Because Sultan had swapped with another tenant to move into the home, the housing association quoted the law that said it was up to the two of them to sort out the mess. After Sultan pleaded with the previous tenant, Clarion moved everything - as far as the front yard. Some promised work was done but on other jobs Sultan kept getting fobbed off [see footnote]. Chanel Sultan points out cracks in her wall. Photograph: Jill MeadThe Guardian The filth drove the family to angry rows. Her eldest daughter moved out, while her teenage son tried sofa-surfing. The baby of the family, a shy fawn of a girl still in primary school, kept breaking down in tears. A longtime sufferer of poor mental health, Sultan felt herself slide into despair. In emails she sent to the housing association, which I have seen, she reports a manager shouting down the phone: I dont care about your mental health, your mental health condition has nothing to do with the house, and: You will live there with the rats until we come and get rid of them. She tried to kill herself three times. After walking out into oncoming traffic, she wrote to Clarion: I want to take my life. I am just too sad ... I dont think I will ever be helped or understood. The reply began: Im sorry to hear that the messages you received from [the previous tenant] caused you to want to end your life. When I contacted Clarion, it said: We sincerely apologise to Ms Sultan. Every resident should be treated fairly, with respect and compassion. It disputes some parts of her story that I havent mentioned, yet adds: We are determined to continuously improve the service we provide and we will learn from this case. It has made several similar statements over the past couple of years, as stories of appalling treatment of other tenants are splashed on telly or brought to regulators. At the offices of Sultans Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, staff have to deal with Clarion on residents behalf every day. In the constituency next door, Labours Siobhain McDonagh made the papers in 2021 for estimating Clarion comprised half her casework. Its just as high today, the MP tells me: I dont think that their tenants and leaseholders will have seen any improvement. We could park all this at the door of a housing association that is too big to fail, yet is a serial failure. Its board features such establishment figures as Gavin Barwell, the housing minister just before Grenfell went up in flames, as well as big names who worked at Rothschild and Savills - but not one tenant. The chief executive of this charity, Clare Miller, took home over PS369,000 last year. Boxes are stacked floor to ceiling in the front room of Chanel Sultans home. Photograph: Jill MeadThe Guardian Yet, ultimately, Chanel Sultan has been failed by a society that scarcely notices people like her, let alone protects their rights. The weekend papers carry their property supplements, the BBC brings you Homes Under the Hammer. No such loving attention is paid to the 4 million households in England alone who rent from a housing association or a council. Related: Im willing to take on absolutely everyone! Kwajo Tweneboa on fighting for Britains poorest tenants For this piece, the Guardians archivists went through five years of national newspaper stories and totted up how many focused on social housing. In a period that includes the aftermath of Grenfell, the cladding scandal and the death of the toddler Awaab Ishak from respiratory failure in a mould-infested home, there were 1,315 reports. Over the same period there were 6,312 articles - five times as many - on house prices alone. In a country sharply divided between those who own assets and those who dont, the media and political system stands squarely behind the asset-owners. Looking at the first year of the pandemic for her new book, Stay Home, Prof Becky Tunstall documents how far the then chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, went to prop up the housing market: cuts in stamp duty, mortgage holidays, lower interest rates, quantitative easing. The expensive medicine worked a treat. Where house prices had been forecast to plunge, the average home instead rocketed by PS37,000 in one year. For households, she calculates, that sum dwarfed the value of furlough, help for the self-employed and the uplift for universal credit. Meanwhile, renters are so unprotected that, to get a home fit for a human, Sultan had to go to superhuman lengths: numerous emails to Clarion, to the regulators, taking on solicitors, even complaining on TikTok - for which she was hit with a letter from Clarions lawyers, even as its contractors set about doing more repairs. Hours after receiving my questions, the housing association got in touch with the family again - even offering to proof the house against rats. Clarion says: We are pleased that the majority of work is now complete, with full completion due next week. Sultan reads books with titles such as Think and Grow Rich, yet the lives of her and her children have been stunted by not being rich - and no amount of magical thinking will change that. In a society that tells everyone they can be whatever they want, she still aspires to be an entrepreneur, but she and her family have learned the hard way that promises are not reality. I feel like Im a prisoner of my circumstances, she says. Like, if youre not a certain class, youre not taken seriously.

An earlier version said the family were assured the central heating and double glazing would be addressed before they arrived at the property. Clarion told the Guardian after publication that the heating work had originally been scheduled for 5 July 2022 (two weeks after the family moved in), and that it had no record of a promise regarding the glazing. While the family maintains assurances were given, the article has been clarified that this is their contention. Clarion also noted the broken door lock was repaired the day after it was reported, and the electrical wiring within 12 days; it added that a larger scheduled programme of repairs was delayed for some weeks when the family requested works be halted to allow for an independent survey. Although Clarion initially agreed to remove the previous tenants belongings only to the front yard, as reported, it told us it later paid for the uncollected items to be taken away.

On Tuesday, a study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank outlined some of them, including reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and managing the transition to automation in parts of the economy. The report also highlighted a new social divide, one that emerged in the context of Covid and is likely, in some form, to remain when the pandemic is behind us. In 2019, only 5% of employees worked mainly from home, but that number grew to almost 50% during the first and third lockdowns. Remote working has become particularly prevalent among the higher-paid and higher-educated, as a substantial part of the knowledge economy successfully migrates to affluent suburbs in London and elsewhere. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics this week reveal that 70% of all staff in Richmond upon Thames worked from home at some point during the pandemic. The equivalent figure in Burnley was less than 14%. The implications of this shift, and its social composition, need to be thought through. For millions of mostly better-off citizens able to work from home, a hybrid working week - part-home, part-office - seems likely in the future. This will have a sizeable impact on the countrys economic geography. The Nationwide building society and Santander UK, for example, have already announced the closure of swathes of urban office space. Nationwide has advised 13,000 staff that they are free to work at home from anywhere in the country. HSBC intends to cut office space, but require its staff to come in for part of the week. As other businesses follow suit, and the shift to online shopping continues, the decline of high streets and urban centres may accelerate. Providers of local goods and services, stranded in the physical economy, may struggle and may be forced to relocate. Places and individuals that could be losers in this process must be properly supported and provided with meaningful options and assistance. For businesses, the main advantage of staying wholly or partly on Zoom is obvious: in one recent survey, 88% of organisations said that they made real-estate savings in 2020 through remote working; 92% expected further cost reductions in the next two to three years. For employees, the picture is more complicated. The loss of a stressful daily commute has certainly not been mourned. But as a short-term novelty has turned into the new normal, there has been evidence of a sense of social disconnection, burnout and falling morale. Matthew Taylor, the author of a 2017 government review on work, warned this month that a high level of working from home risked creating highly atomised workforces, lacking the kind of solidarity and mutual support that should be part of a good working experience. Andy Haldane, the Bank of Englands outgoing chief economist, has suggested that an online working world can become a long-term drain on creativity and collaboration. For young people starting out in their careers, the physical workplace provides crucial opportunities to bond with colleagues and get the feel of an organisation. In some form, working from home is set to remain part of millions of peoples lives. But there must be careful thinking on how to mitigate its downsides, both for those in the virtual working world and those trying to make a living outside it.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"society\/2022\/jun\/26\/a-finite-resource-as-australia-recruits-overseas-health-workers-their-home-nations-bear-the-cost","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2022\/jun\/26\/a-finite-resource-as-australia-recruits-overseas-health-workers-their-home-nations-bear-the-cost","DATE":"2022-06-25 20:00:24","PLAIN_TEXT":"Moving to Australia from New Zealand was not a decision Ava* made lightly. We moved to New Zealand for the big Kiwi dream, she says. The country was beautiful, the lifestyle we had was magnificent. Originally from the UK, Ava has been a nurse for over 20 years. But after more than a decade working in hospitals there, where she says she encountered bullying, she was at the end of her tether. When we decided that enough was enough, that my career wasnt going anywhere ... and the working life of bullying and put-downs was just not worth it any more, we looked more closely at Australia, she says. Ava took up short-term contract work in Australia before she and her family made the move permanently. She now lives in Queensland, and worked throughout the Covid pandemic. Im on a hell of a lot more money here than what I was in New Zealand, she says. That wasnt my big driving force, but I know thats a big driver for other nurses who have moved from New Zealand to Australia. When the New South Wales government announced a $4.5bn pledge in early June to boost the states health workforce by more than 10,000 over four years, the news was received frostily across the Tasman. Related: Thousands of NSW nurses to strike in defiance of Industrial Relations Commission ruling The chief executive of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, Paul Goulter, expressed concern that the recruitment drive - which is set to hire 7,500 doctors, nurses and allied health professionals over the following 12 months - would result in more staff being lost to Australia. Whilst theres always been a number of nurses and other healthcare workers go backwards and forwards, theres a real sense that its so bad over here that we may lose more than what we would normally, Goulter told Radio New Zealand. Other Australian states have announced similar campaigns to attract healthcare workers from overseas. The Queensland government announced this week that it would target foreign doctors and nurses for recruitment, while Western Australias relocation incentive, which ends this month, includes a reimbursement of $5,000 for flights to Perth. Health workers have been migrating internationally for decades, moving for better pay, better working conditions, or the allure of a different lifestyle. But as countries focus recruitment efforts internationally to ease domestic pressures, experts warn that it may worsen existing inequalities amid a global shortage of healthcare workers. A global shortfall The Covid-19 pandemic exerted a heavy toll on health systems around the world. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 180,000 healthcare workers died globally between January 2020 and May last year as a result of Covid. More than 75 countries have put in place regulatory mechanisms to make it easier to recruit international healthcare workers, says James Campbell, the director of health workforce at the WHO. The longstanding underinvestment in health systems meant that when additional demands were placed on health systems they didnt have the capacity to respond, he says. Many ... countries around the world had to rapidly look for additional recruitment mechanisms. Even before the pandemic, there was a large shortfall in healthcare professionals. A WHO report estimated that in 2018 there was a shortage of 5.9 million nurses, who account for the majority - about 59% - of the health workforce. The report also found that one in eight nurses globally works in a different country from where they were born.

The US, UK, Germany, Finland, Australia and New Zealand are among the top destination countries for migrating nurses, says Howard Catton, the chief executive of the International Council of Nurses, which represents more than 130 national nurse associations. India and the Philippines - which  very deliberately educat[es] more nurses than they need - have historically been sources of high numbers of migrant nurses, he says. The ICN has noted that the pandemic has driven up the demand for nurses in destination countries, with the number of nurse vacancies almost doubling in Canada and the UK. Related: Ambulance Victoria begins winding back non-paramedic surge workforce Recruitment drives in wealthy countries risk exacerbating stark inequalities that predate the pandemic, Catton says. If you look at statistics around the numbers of nurses per head of population ... you can see a tenfold difference, sometimes more, between low- or lower-middle-income countries and higher-income countries. Figures range from 10 to 15 nurses per 10,000 people in some African and south-east Asian countries to more than 100 per 10,000 in the US or UK, Catton says. If youre a high-income country and you havent educated enough nurses to meet your own needs and then you decide to recruit from somewhere else to fill those needs ... youre offloading the costs of education for that nurse. But healthcare worker migration is not uniquely a movement from the global south to the global north, Campbell says, noting there had also been shifts across OECD countries. Dana*, who works for an international recruitment agency for nurses in Australia, says most of the health workers she encounters are migrating from the UK and Ireland, many of whom previously worked in Covid wards or intensive care units. Theyve had a hard time in Europe over the last two years or so, she says. Opportunities are better here as well. The healthcare system is impeccable [in Australia], so its not as tough to be a nurse here as it is [there], especially during Covid times. Prior to the pandemic, the WHO estimated a shortage of 18 million health workers by 2030 - most of these in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Burnout among fatigued health workers may only worsen the problem. The ICN estimates an additional 3 million nurses may quit early as a result of Covid-19, and has been concerned by an increase in industrial action globally. Greater investment in health systems are needed to handle future increases in healthcare demand due to growing and ageing populations, Catton says. We think that all countries should aim for self-sufficiency, he says. That doesnt mean that people cant move and migrate, but ... we would like to see countries planning to produce enough nurses to meet their own needs. We have the global ambition of universal health coverage as part of the sustainable development goals, Campbell says. Achieving this requires more than just the international movement of a finite - and insufficient - number of healthcare workers. You cant have global competition for a finite resource, he says. You need global collaboration. *some names have been changed","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2023\/feb\/05\/putting-up-a-shelf-how-hard-can-that-be","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2023\/feb\/05\/putting-up-a-shelf-how-hard-can-that-be","DATE":"2023-02-05 09:15:17","PLAIN_TEXT":"I am staring at the wall. I hold in my hand a drill, a screw and a wall plug. My son has brought his own toy tool set with him, too, and has been sawing the bed, the floor and my legs to help. If he were really trying to ape my technique he would have brought a toy phone, for I have prepared for this task by watching YouTube. Specifically, videos designed for people who, like me, have spent their lives avoiding basic DIY as if it were illegal. These YouTubers are real men. Manly men. Men who, thankfully, speak to me about basic DIY in that affectionate tone you might use if you found an unaccompanied child weeping in a shopping centre. Lets get this wall drilled, shall we? they chuckle, as I dab my face with a rapidly dampening sleeve, Come on now, no tears, well get this all sorted out together!. My son produces a plastic spirit level and uses it like a hammer. His toy hammer is in his baby sisters mouth, causing her to retch slightly, which she seems to find pleasing. I continue watching kind men rattle off commandments about masonry versus wood walls, tapping the surface and judging it by the sound - dunkkk vs diunkkk - as if theyre a master tracker from a jungle survival movie, deducing via smell that some elk came through here, two days past. Both sound similar to me - especially over the retching - and neither is like the one Im getting from my own wall, so I decide its wood. There are injunctions to stay away from electrical wiring. I make a note to develop x-ray vision to avoid this. Then come the basics re bits and screws and I spot that the settings on their drills are slightly different from my own. They seem certain you need to get this stuff exact, but I can already feel my brain deliberately ignoring this and hoping I can just wing it. This is, in so many ways, the exact nexus of my problem; I have formed a perfectly poisonous combination of horror and complacency toward my own ignorance. I avoid doing almost any DIY task because I know how clueless I am. And yet! On those rare, rare occasions I do give it a go, I immediately assume Im a DIY savant and carry the job out as quickly and carelessly as possible. I fail, and fail, and fail, until some cruel satire of DIY has been achieved - two prints hung nearly straight, surrounded by a constellation of surplus holes, a shelf that is definitely up, but at a 15-degree angle I tell myself I find not just safe, but jaunty and pleasing.

At least 40,000 care home residents have died of Covid-19 so far in England and Wales, along with hundreds of valiant workers. Surely we have to do everything feasible to prevent these figures going even higher as a result of the Delta variant, or any future variants. Theres no doubt that this is what the government is seeking to achieve in moving to a compulsory vaccination approach - its a defensive strategy, based on the fear of a challenging winter battling coronavirus, plus maybe seasonal flu, to come. Yet I know that Age UK was by no means the only organisation with an interest in social care that did not express full-blooded support for the idea when responding to the governments recent consultation. Of course, it is in older peoples best interests for everyone who engages with them to be fully vaccinated, whether they live in a care home or their own home. What we were less convinced about was whether compulsorily vaccinating this particular group of care staff, and doing it now, is the best way of getting there. Related: Mandatory Covid jabs for care workers in England unworkable, warn bosses The big potential problem with going down the mandatory path is that it may cause some care home staff to move to another job they can do without having their Covid-19 jabs. There is huge annual churn in social care, with as many as one in three staff leaving their roles. Some quit care altogether but many go to another company, lured by better terms and conditions. Care home staff could also move to become healthcare assistants in the NHS, with better pay and prospects for doing an almost identical job - one of many problems that bedevil social care recruitment and retention. The risk of some vaccine-hesitant care home staff leaving would matter much less if the care workforce was in better shape overall. There are some 120,000 vacancies, so about one in 10 roles are unfilled. Social care is the consummate people job, so the quality of care someone receives in a care home, for example, depends not only on the skills of the staff but on there being enough of them. An older person with advanced dementia may require painstaking one-on-one support to eat and drink enough during the day. If thats impossible because of understaffing then they are at major risk of malnutrition and dehydration, threatening their health and even their survival. One of the strongest arguments against mandatory vaccination, therefore, is that it risks making an already challenging workforce situation worse, with awful consequences for residents. Remember, too, that these new regulations will hit temporary agency staff, on whom care homes have previously relied to fill gaps, as well as permanent workers. This is not the only recent blow to the social care workforce. Brexit and the immigration rules that the government subsequently introduced mean that, as things stand, care workers from the EU will be unable in future to come here to work. There are anecdotal reports that Brexit has led to some existing EU care staff returning home. Such staff are mostly clustered in London and other big cities, some of the places where vaccine hesitancy among staff is also known to be most prevalent - partly because there are greater numbers of black African staff who academic research have found to be considerably more averse to taking up the vaccine than their white British counterparts. Care homes in these areas therefore potentially face a double whammy as regards staffing, if mandatory vaccination leads some workers to leave, on top of Brexit. I could contemplate mandatory vaccination as a last resort, but Im not sure that everything that could be done to encourage voluntary take-up among care home staff has been fully tried. The NHS has run some excellent myth-busting webinars for care workers, but many will no doubt have missed out. The experience to date is that hyper-local approaches, based on peer-to-peer support, really do work. With the government announcing a 16-week grace period before the new regulations bite, I hope care homes and councils will work together to encourage every worker who is yet to take up their jab to do so, especially in those areas with the furthest to go. This policy change would have landed so much better if it had been part of a funded package of reforms, designed to give care workers the professional respect they richly deserve, and pay and conditions to match. Its not impossible that this will come later in the year but, on its own, mandatory vaccination feels to me and many others like too much stick and not enough carrot for a workforce who have given their all and been through the fire these past 15 months, quite possibly with more to come. Caroline Abrahams is charity director for Age UK This article was amended on 30 June 2021 to remove a line saying that under the new policy only staff members in care homes for older people are required to be vaccinated [which] means that a worker could move to a care home helping young disabled adults, or into domiciliary care instead. At the time the article was written, the plan was limited to care homes for older people. But during a delay in publication of this piece, the requirement was extended to all Care Quality Commission-registered care homes.

Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder of the dating app Bumble, has just given her entire company a week off to recover from what one senior executive (in a swiftly deleted tweet) called our collective burnout, following similar gestures at Facebook and LinkedIn. Related: Post-Covid work patterns must not be imposed by bosses with an eye on cost Some may wonder what exactly theyve all been doing to their staff to leave them craving a break. But if Bumble employees have emerged from a mentally and physically draining year of holding things together in a pandemic feeling frankly knackered, then theyre certainly not alone. The big thing Wolfe Herd seems to have got right, meanwhile, is making clear that this is time off for everybody. Its not designed as an opportunity for the psychopathically ambitious to make a point of coming into the office anyway, just to show how terribly committed they are. Its not one of those paper perks that technically anyone could ask for but which would obviously spell career suicide in practice, with the result that everyone is too paranoid to actually take advantage, yet the company still gets to polish its halo in public. (Those take whatever holiday you want policies fashionable among tech companies in the noughties may sound generous, but in intensely competitive industries they can paradoxically lead to people taking less time off for fear of looking like the office slacker.) And as British office life emerges from hibernation, theres a lesson here. When lockdowns began to lift, this spring and last, some companies noticed a phenomenon of people coming into the office even when they werent obliged to, seeing it as a chance to hobnob with senior managers (often the only people still at their desks) and get one over on rivals still stuck obediently at home. The home workers perennial fear of being excluded from some loop that they didnt know existed is seeping anxiously back, and may only increase when the work from home rule is finally abandoned (theoretically on 19 July, if the government sticks to its Covid roadmap). Companies that are offering staff the freedom to choose whether they return to the office post-pandemic or carry on working mostly from home on a permanent basis may be doing so for the most generous of reasons. Yet as Prof Cary Cooper, the psychologist and president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, has pointed out, they risk inadvertently deepening the gender divide if its predominantly women with caring responsibilities who end up taking the home option. Unless men - young and old, senior and junior, fathers or not - also seize the chance to ditch the commute, move out of the city or make a lifestyle change, then the new flexibility will inevitably become associated with being on a mummy track, and be held against those who take it up. Its clear that many men do want something to change. One survey of people who had worked from home during the pandemic, conducted by the IT firm Atlas Cloud, found that 87% of respondents wanted to continue doing so at least some of the time. The charity Working Families found that 56% of fathers enjoyed spending more time with their children during lockdown, while men who pitched in with home schooling and housework may have seen some knock-on benefits for their relationships; two in five couples felt the domestic load was more fairly shared during the pandemic, and younger couples in particular wanted to carry on that way. But history suggests that a fear of being judged at work often stops men doing what they might otherwise do. Only 2% of fathers take up their right to shared parental leave allowing couples to split maternity leave between them - which isnt all that surprising, when many will have seen female colleagues careers suffer after having a baby. Working Families found that one in four men thought parenthood would make them more vulnerable to redundancy when furlough ends. The equalities minister, Liz Truss, has sent some helpful signals that the government is considering introducing flexible working by default - normalising it for everyone unless theres a good reason why its impossible, which would take the pressure off workers having to go into personal details to justify why they wanted it. Labour would go further, with a universal right to flexible working unless theres reason to refuse. The political climate should encourage employers to be bold, knowing that change is coming anyway, and take advantage of potential cost savings on office space. But senior men need to lead by example, making clear that younger mens careers wont suffer for taking advantage, and both companies and government must monitor very carefully the gendered takeup of home working and its impact on pay or prospects. Ministers should also publicly link the idea of more home working - which could mean less commuter traffic and reduced carbon emissions - to helping companies meet their own net-zero goals. Ultimately, men may have to be as bold as women have had to be in the past, knowing that theres safety in numbers. Of course, some workers cant wait to be back in the office, after months of fighting their flatmates for space at the kitchen table, and thats fair enough. But for the rest, the moral of the pandemic is arguably that life is short and too precious to waste. Take it or lose it - for this may be a once-in-a-generation chance for change.

Guys and St Thomas trust (GSTT) in London has had to cancel operations, postpone appointments and divert seriously ill patients to other hospitals in the capital as a result of its IT meltdown. The situation means that doctors cannot see patients medical notes remotely and are having to write down the results of all examinations by hand. They are also unable to remotely access the results of diagnostic tests such as X-rays and CT and MRI scans and are instead having to call the imaging department, which is overloading the departments telephone lines. GSTT has declared the problem a critical site incident. It has apologised to patients and asked them to bring letters or other paperwork about their condition with them to their appointment to help overcome doctors loss of access to their medical history. Both its datacentres, one at Guys hospital and the other at St Thomas hospital, stopped working on Tuesday afternoon as Britain experienced record temperatures. The air conditioning units intended to keep them cool failed, sources at the trust said. As a result, the trusts 23,500 staff lost access to the clinical applications they use to store and share information about patients history and condition. GSTT confirmed on Thursday afternoon that the problem was unresolved. It has significantly disrupted the normal functioning of GSTTs hospitals. For safety reasons, the trust has been forced to divert to other hospitals four types of very unwell patients it was due to admit: those with heart problems, awaiting an organ transplant, with vascular problems and those due to receive potentially life-saving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. One doctor at GSTT, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: This is having a major effect. We are back to using paper and cant see any existing electronic notes. We are needing to triage basic tests like blood tests and scans. Theres no access to results apart from over the phone, and of course the whole hospital is trying to use that line. Frankly, its a big patient safety issue and we havent been told how long it will take to fix. We are on divert for major specialist services such as cardiac, vascular and ECMO. GSTT is a regional centre of excellence for several areas of specialist care, including lung problems, critical care and transplants. The trust has publicly acknowledged, through messages on its Twitter feed, that it has been experiencing problems with its technology but has given few details about the extent of the disruption caused. Soon after the meltdown first occurred on Tuesday it tweeted: We are having some problems with our IT and telephone systems. On Wednesday it said: We continue to have some problems with our IT and telephone systems, which we are working hard to fix. On Thursday it tweeted again to say it was still working hard to fix problems with our IT systems. It gave little detail in any of the tweets about the scale of the disruption. However, in its tweets on Thursday it gave a hint about how services were being affected, apologising to patients who have had trouble contacting us or had any issues accessing our services. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter - every weekday morning at 7am BST It then added: We are trying to contact anyone whose appointment we need to cancel. If you are visiting us today, please bring any letters or paperwork we have sent you to your appointment, to help us reduce the risk of delays. In a statement, Guys and St Thomas NHS foundation trust said: As a result of the extreme temperatures on Tuesday we have experienced significant disruption to our IT systems, which is having an ongoing impact on our services. While the majority of appointments have gone ahead, unfortunately we have had to postpone some operations and appointments and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. The trust has well-established business continuity plans to allow us to continue as much activity as possible and to ensure that patient safety is prioritised at all times.

For decades we have known that people like working from home because it increases the control they have over their lives. Being able to decide when and how to work - including taking time out to watch a football match or greet children returning from school - improves everyones life, no matter their class or profession. Covid has exposed, not created, stark spatial and social inequalities in our society. In May last year, when most middle-class people were working full-time from home, safely out of the way of the virus, only one in five working class people were - and the infection and death rates reflect this. This is a paradigm shift equivalent to the invention of the factory and requires a society-wide response in terms of the built environment, employment practices and more. Only a small minority of employers are monitoring their employees activity. Most are celebrating the fact that their staff are happier, healthier and equally or more productive - and that, simultaneously, they need less office space and so can reduce overheads. Win-win. Home and downtime were already fatally blurred - who hasnt checked their email before bed or on waking? Homeworking is a skill, and people have radically different approaches to the degree of separation they like between the home and work aspects of their lives. Being able to close the door on work at the end of the day is important for many, which is why garden offices are flying off the shelves. Crucially, our job now is to build a society - and cities, neighbourhoods, blocks, buildings and homes - that make this a real possibility for everyone who chooses it.

There wasnt enough time to grab essentials or documents - rapidly rising waters were already waist-high and surging through the small community in Monterey county. Rubio and her family of eight had little time to lose. Related: Atmospheric rivers are inundating California - but what are they? It has felt traumatic, she said. The water came and destroyed our house. It destroyed everything. Just after midnight on Friday, sirens wailed through the town of Pajaro, warning residents it was time to leave. Engorged by unrelenting rains, the river that snakes alongside the community had escaped its banks and ageing levees ruptured against the weight of the furious waterway. Parts of the town were quickly steeped in brown-tinged water deep enough to submerge cars, inundate key infrastructure and soak homes, leaving thousands displaced. The Pajaro flood is the latest in a series of weather-caused catastrophes that have rocked California since last December. The recently drought-stricken state has been drenched, as the deluges chewed into saturated hillsides that sent mud and debris cascading across highways and into homes. Mountain towns tucked along the Sierra Nevada range have been buried by snow as the cold conditions and thrashing winds caused widespread power outages and cut off both access and escape. It has felt traumatic. The water came and destroyed our house. It destroyed everything Gertrudis Rubio As the sun burst through the darkened clouds during a brief reprieve from the storms on Monday, emergency response crews in boats, high-clearance vehicles or on foot wading through the waters rushed through the vacant streets of Pajaro to secure the water-soaked neighborhoods and provide aid for those still in their homes. Our number one priority is the preservation of life but second to that is the preservation of property, said Battalion Chief Gino Degraffenreid. The clang of a submerged railroad crossing perpetually echoed in the distance. Assigned with Californias office of emergency services water team 11 out of Marin county, Degraffenreid and his team were one of a dozen deployed throughout the state to provide emergency support during the storms. Ian Hanson, a fire captain with the southern Marin fire department, has spent days in Pajaro helping with the rescue and recovery effort. Photograph: Gabrielle CanonThe Guardian He had spent the preceding day helping a few remaining residents escape. Among them, a priest from a local parish who offered a prayer for the crews in return. There were several pets left behind during the rush to get out that have since been safely delivered to their frantic families. Still, there are some people who have chosen to stay. Much of the work now, Degraffenreid said, was trying to re-establish critical infrastructure, including clean water access and sewage. We are trying to restore normalcy as quickly as possible, he added. The task is a daunting one. Three water systems have been identified as potentially contaminated, according to county officials. Eleven schools have had to close, and hundreds of people are being housed in shelters where beds are mostly full. County officials are bracing for more evacuations and new impacts from the next big rain. The levee breach, which tripled in size between Friday and Monday is now 400ft wide. There is ongoing work to secure and stabilize it with rocks and sandbags but the damage is significant. And this isnt the first time the levee has failed. For decades it has been clear that the levee was vulnerable. There was catastrophic flooding here three times in the 1990s, including one breach that left two dead and caused up to $95m in damage. Waters rose again in 2017 and evacuations were ordered just this past January, when the state was pummeled by a series of severe storms. Despite the known dangers, needed repairs hadnt been done. Its a low-income area, Stu Townsley, the US army corps of engineers deputy district engineer for project management for the San Francisco region, told the Los Angeles Times, noting that mostly farm workers live in Pajaro. Therefore, you get basically Bay Area construction costs but the value of property isnt all that high. Four-year-old Adriel evacuated with his family before dawn on Saturday, one of hundreds who were sheltering at the Santa Cruz county fairgrounds. Photograph: Gabrielle CanonThe Guardian Roughly 3,000 people call Pajaro home and 92% of them are Hispanic, according to census records. Just over 18% fall below the poverty line and per capita income - $15,018 - is about a third of what it is statewide. In 2022, state and federal funds were allocated to repair the levee - a project expected to cost roughly $400m - but construction wasnt slated to start until 2024 at the earliest. Now, at an emergency shelter staged at the Santa Cruz county fairgrounds to the north, hundreds wait and wonder what will remain of their homes when the waters recede. Rubio, housed with hundreds of others in a large room filled with cots, watched as her four-year-old brother, Adriel, drew a pink cat with donated crayons. We have nowhere to go, she said solemnly. She wished there were rubber bands to pull her long hair back, but more importantly she worried about her sister, who has seizures, and where the family will live when the water recedes. We will stay here until its over, she said. But we dont have enough money to pay rent. Levees on the Pajaro River failed on Friday night, inundating the town and forcing residents to seek emergency shelter. Photograph: Gabrielle CanonThe Guardian Shes not alone, and others just trying to get through the next several days are anticipating the struggle that could stretch across the coming years. Its clear from what I am hearing that for many people there will be no place to go back to, said Michael Flores, a deputy secretary for Californias department of food and agriculture. As the official who oversees the fairgrounds across the state - sites that are often used during disasters - he is hoping to gain a better understanding of peoples most urgent needs. There are requests for better food and staples like tortillas, rice and beans. There is also a need for insulin and other medications. And the spread of Covid is a concern. Flores is taking notes for the future, though, and the broader infrastructure needs of these old buildings, many of which were built in the 1940s and 50s. After all, this wont be the last time this recreation area will be used for emergency response. Not all of our facilities are set up for that, he said, acknowledging that the government is not always nimble. Because of climate change we know the effect is long term - this is not just something that is going to go away. With a $150m planned investment in resiliency centers across the state, Flores said he would like to see retrofits or new buildings that have the amenities that older ones lack, such as HVAC systems, commercial grade kitchens and proper hygiene facilities. Lorina Sosa, who had been at the shelter through the weekend, said she was appreciative of the aid but felt like more could have been done to prepare. She evacuated Friday night after emergency responders knocked on her door, and arrived at the shelter to find that cots hadnt yet been set up for the surge in evacuees that would soon land at its doors. We were struggling before this. And we all still have lives that are going on Lorina Sosa Her elderly parents, who evacuated during the storms in January, were wary of a repeat experience - last time they had both contracted Covid while housed in shelters. But when the warnings started to echo through their neighborhood on Friday night, Sosa knew it was a risk they would all have to take. Her boyfriend was out of town, working in Bakersfield when the rains started, so it was up to her to get the family - which includes her boyfriends two sisters, niece and brother-in-law, along with the parents and three dogs - to safety. Buddy and Icy, two large and loving pitbulls, werent allowed inside and had to be tied up just outside the shelter. We were struggling before this, Sosa said, her thoughts filled with the future and what was left behind. And we all still have lives that are going on. She wonders whether her nieces beautiful quinceanera dress, just weeks away from when it would be worn, survived the floods. They went all the way to Mexico to get it, she said with a sigh, adding: She is being such a good sport, poor thing. Lorina Sosa and her parents landed in the Santa Cruz county fairgrounds shelter last Friday - the second time they have had to evacuate this year. Photograph: Gabrielle CanonThe Guardian But by Monday evening Sosa would get some good news. On a small metal boat, Ian Hanson, a fire captain with the southern Marin fire department, and Esteban Cespedes, a San Rafael fire captain - two members of Degraffenreids team - had located her home. Receiving the message that her cats were still inside, and with her permission to enter, they waded into the water that reached up to their waists. The cats were safe and secure. The inside of the house, miraculously, was still dry. Its a hopeful update, and one not everyone in the community will be lucky enough to receive. The sodden state isnt yet through its very wet winter - another atmospheric river is expected to unleash more rain across California through the end of the week. The waters in Pajaro may yet rise further. Mother Nature is always reminding us that she is in charge, Degraffenreid said.

There were more than 360,000 positive tests recorded around the country in the past week, and nearly half a million people are isolating with active Covid-19. Related: Tested positive for Covid? Australian experts on how to manage at home and when to go to hospital Thanks to vaccination and the less severe but highly transmissible Omicron variant, the vast majority of people who get Covid will have symptoms that are manageable at home. If you are self-isolating with Covid, these are some treatments and techniques that may help to alleviate symptoms. Covid at home generally Support services and home care guides are available to help people assess Covid symptoms, including the coronavirus hotline on 1800 675 398, the federal governments Health Direct guidelines, and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners guide. Stay hydrated Staying well hydrated is important after a Covid diagnosis, says Dr Suzi Nou, a Melbourne anaesthetist who has been managing Covid-positive patients in the community. Since the surge of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, Nou has noticed an increase in Covid patients presenting mainly with gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in children and teenagers, which can contribute to dehydration. Their presenting symptom is diarrhoea or vomiting, Nou says, also noting nausea, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Ive been surprised with how dehydrated people have been getting. She advises her Covid patients to avoid spicy and rich foods and to really keep the fluids up. It seems to be - more so than your usual cold - something that can really upset your tummy and cause dehydration. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning. The RACGPs home care guide suggests individuals manage hydration carefully through small regular sips of fluid, and consider oral rehydration salts such as Hydralyte. To avoid dehydration, you should drink water before you feel thirsty, according to Health and Wellbeing Queensland. An easy way to tell if you are hydrated enough is by the colour of your urine - drink enough so it is pale yellow. Lie prone A cough or mild shortness of breath may be improved by lying on your front rather than your back. Prone positioning may improve oxygen levels in the blood, according to Covid-19 clinical evidence taskforce guidelines. We know that more of your lung tissue is at your back, says Nou. If you lie on your front, the effects of gravity mean that the water in your lungs will come to your front so youll have more lung surface area to help with breathing. Severe difficulty breathing or worsening shortness of breath, however, are considered red flags that indicate someone may need hospital care, as are fainting or collapse and blue lips or face. Nasal sprays may also help to provide relief for symptoms of nasal congestion, the RACGP guide suggests. Rest if fatigued I repeat to all my patients that Covid infects your whole body. Lets get away from this idea of it just being a respiratory illness, Nou says. If you are getting fatigued, to me thats a sign that you do have some of it affecting your brain, which is very common. Other common symptoms include difficulty concentrating, visual changes, and mood disturbances. Nous advice is to let your brain rest, particularly when youre in that first seven to 14 days of being unwell. She suggests to her patients to minimise time spent in front of screens. Its a little bit like if people have a concussion. Related: Australian election 2022: how to vote by phone if you are in Covid isolation The fatigue may persist after the acute infection, and a staged return to work or school may be necessary for some. Some people can get back to work [straight away] and be fine, says Nou. Some people take a little bit longer. Its not like muscle [that you] just keep pushing and working harder, and get stronger and better. Its actually inflammation, she says. With inflammation, youre actually better off ... reducing activity and letting [it] settle. Can drugs or vitamins help? Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be taken to alleviate symptoms, including a fever or body aches. Experts note that pregnant women, however, should avoid ibuprofen. Doctors may prescribe oral antiviral drugs for certain people with mild Covid who are at higher risk of developing severe disease - such as those who are unvaccinated, older than 60, or have underlying chronic medical conditions. There is little clinical evidence to suggest that vitamin supplements are beneficial in treating or preventing Covid. Vitamin D - which can be toxic in high doses - has been discussed in relation to the coronavirus, but one systematic review found: The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of Covid-19 is very uncertain. A 2021 clinical trial in people with mild Covid-19 found that taking high-dose zinc, vitamin C or a combination of the two supplements had no benefit in reducing the duration of symptoms. Australias clinical evidence taskforce guidelines don not recommend zinc, among certain other therapeutics, as a treatment for Covid: There is not enough evidence to support the safe and effective use of these drugs. In addition, vitamin C is water soluble; if you consume more than your body can store, it isnt toxic, but it is excreted in urine. Excess vitamin C literally goes down the toilet, Healthdirect, the national public health information service, points out. In many cases, as health experts have previously pointed out, taking multivitamins just results in very expensive urine. Preventing transmission Getting an adequate sleep and having a balanced diet may help to boost ones immune system, but the best protections against Covid are oft-repeated public health measures: getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing a mask, and opting to spend time outdoor or in well-ventilated spaces. The biggest thing in terms of not getting infected - rather than boosting your immune system and spending money on vitamins and supplements - is just avoiding high-risk situations and wearing the right protection while having to go into high-risk situations, says Nou. Id rather spend my money on an N95 mask.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/apr\/13\/italys-superbonus-110-scheme-prompts-surge-of-green-home-renovations","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/apr\/13\/italys-superbonus-110-scheme-prompts-surge-of-green-home-renovations","DATE":"2022-04-13 05:00:44","PLAIN_TEXT":"For years, people living in Castelnuovo di Porto, a medieval village close to Rome, had put off doing maintenance jobs on their homes, whether it be fixing the roof or cracks in walls caused by earthquakes, because they could not afford it.

As the name suggests, homeowners are entitled to a tax credit of up to 110% on the cost of upgrading their home, such as installing insulation systems, heat pumps and solar panels or replacing an old boiler, or undertaking works that reduce the risk of damage from seismic activity. People can claim the subsidy by subtracting the costs of the works from their tax returns over a five-year period, or pass the onus on to the building contractor, who subtracts it from their taxes or sells the credit to a bank, which in turn is refunded by the government. The extra 10% covers bank interest. The scheme applies to works on either single houses or buildings that contain more than one home, although in these cases the permission of the other homeowners is needed. Warde-Jones has come together with four shared homeowners to do several jobs on their 18th-century tufa stone house totalling more than EUR200,000, including replacing the roof. Its been a bit of a nightmare from the point of view of organising four different families, but were getting there, said Warde-Jones. Work has not yet started, but the bureaucratic side of things is well on its way. Several other EU countries have subsidy schemes for home improvements as they work towards carbon emission reduction goals, but none are as bountiful as Italys. Some say the subsidies, the vast majority of the money coming from the EUs post-Covid recovery fund, are too generous, describing the move as a shock tactic to get the system going in a country with a huge stock of old or poorly constructed buildings. It certainly achieved that. As of 1 March, more than 122,000 applications had been approved. The EU said we need to become a zero-emission society by 2050, and to do that, the entire property stock, private or public, needs to be restructured, said Riccardo Fraccaro, the deputy and senior member of the Five Star Movement who first proposed the superbonus. This was a way to incentivise people and companies to do it. Fraccaro points to the schemes success so far, such as an immediate boost for the construction sector, GDP and the creation of more than 150,000 new jobs. However, soaring demand also pushed up the cost of building services, although Fraccaro said the government had now put price caps on raw materials, and left the limited supply of contractors capable of doing the works booked up to the hilt for at least a year. And even though the initiative impedes illegal activity as the credit can only be claimed via tax returns, Italys tax agency found EUR950m worth of fraud connected to the superbonus and other home improvements schemes late last year. As with everything, there are always those who try to be crafty, but the fraud within the superbonus was minimal, things like people creating fake building sites, said Fraccaro. We are making the system more rigid, although it is very difficult to defraud the superbonus as so many requirements and technical checks are needed before the subsidy is approved. Another issue is the time constraint - the initiative will be gradually reduced in size before ending in 2025. However, the main question is whether the superbonus is having the desired effects. Michele Governatori, from the climate and energy thinktank Ecco, said the scheme was commendable and most definitely needed, especially with buildings in Italy consuming an enormous amount of energy. It will definitely lead to improvements, although how much is too early to say, he said. His main criticism is that the subsidy allows for new gas boilers, ultimately continuing use of fossil fuels. If you replace your old boiler, adding certain efficiency parameters, with a gas one, you can also get a tax rebate. But this is a mistake that needs to be rectified immediately, we need to be using electric heat pumps and detaching from gas. Fraccaro said many households had already detached from gas and in the long-run the initiative would significantly reduce dependence on the fuel, especially in light of Russias invasion of Ukraine. Italy is heavily reliant on gas imports from Russia and, like other European countries, is now scrambling for alternatives. In Castelnuovo di Porto, Sergio Iaquinta, a co-founder of Aiku Srl, an alliance of architects, is busy working on 13 superbonus renovation projects, including the home of Warde-Jones and his neighbours. Iaquinta is also benefiting from the scheme on his own property. He said it was chaotically executed, more so at the beginning, but believes the chaos will be worth it. We have already seen results of insulation works, with clients calling us to say they noticed the difference straight away, he said. And it is helping raise awareness about the climate crisis and environmental needs, which is one of the most important things. This article was amended on 13 April 2022 to make clear that the superbonus scheme operates as a tax credit, rather than a deduction.

Stuart Kennedy, BAs director of people, said there was unlikely to be a single model, with different teams doing different work, and it was clear that some people miss the team spirit and energy that comes from being together. He said it was not clear if such a large office will play a part in our future. He added that BA was working with a specialist property company to gauge if its sale would be beneficial.

With most flights grounded for long periods since last March, BA laid off about a quarter of the 42,000 people it employed pre-Covid, mainly crew and pilots. Any sale of Waterside will also be complicated by the fact that Heathrows third runway plans - back in the frame after a supreme court ruling that it could be built - would mean bulldozing the BA offices. BA said: The global pandemic has shown us that many of our colleagues enjoy working remotely and want to continue, and this has accelerated our approach to offering more agile and flexible ways of working. Our aim is to find a hybrid working model that suits our business, blending the best of office and remote working for our people.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2021\/may\/17\/home-working-doubled-during-uk-covid-pandemic-last-year-mostly-in-london","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/may\/17\/home-working-doubled-during-uk-covid-pandemic-last-year-mostly-in-london","DATE":"2021-05-17 12:38:31","PLAIN_TEXT":"The proportion of people working from home more than doubled in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, though it remained a minority of overall workers across the UK, according to an official snapshot. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said about a quarter of people (25.9%) had worked at home at some point in the week before they responded to officials conducting its annual population survey. It said that this compared with 12.4% of workers in 2019. London However, some staff were more likely to work from home than others in a reflection of the uneven impact and experiences of the health emergency across the UK - with much higher concentrations of workers doing their jobs from home in London than elsewhere. According to the figures, 46.4% of people working in the capital said they worked at home at some point in 2020. The highest proportion of home workers were in affluent suburbs. More than 70% of all staff in the borough of Richmond upon Thames said they had already worked from home. Home working was lowest in rural Scotland and the northern English towns of Burnley and Middlesbrough, where fewer than 14% of employees said they had ever worked from home. The annual population survey included two questions: one asking respondents if they had worked from home in the week prior to being interviewed by ONS officials, and another asking if they had ever done any work from home. There was a smaller increase in the numbers who had ever worked from home at any point, rising from 26.7% in 2019 to 36.5% in 2020. Despite confirming a rise during the pandemic, the figures suggest most of the British workforce continued to travel to workplaces during the health emergency, despite portrayals of abandoned city centres and empty offices in the media. Homeworking by occupation Reflecting the economic landscape of Britain and the ability to transfer some jobs to remote working more than others, cities with larger numbers of office-based jobs in sectors such as finance and IT had higher proportions of people working from home. Places with a higher local share of manufacturing jobs, as well as retail, leisure and hospitality work, had much lower figures. According to the snapshot, more than half of managers, directors, senior officials and professional staff worked from home, compared with fewer than 10% of cleaners, factory workers and drivers. Home workers were more likely to be at an established stage in their career, with people in their 40s twice as likely to be working from home than staff aged 20-24. The proportion of men and women working from home was broadly similar, while black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani workers were less likely to do their jobs from home than white and Chinese workers and those from other ethnic groups. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The figures have been released as lockdown measures are gradually relaxed and more people start to return to city-centre offices, reflected in rising urban footfall, road trips and use of public transport. There is growing speculation over the future of city centres and office-based jobs, as many companies look to retain some flexible working practices. The accountancy firm BDO has told staff to decide for themselves when to come into the office as lockdown measures are eased, enabling staff to work in the most productive location for the task they are doing. KPMG has launched plans for its 16,000 UK staff to work a four-day fortnight in the office, with the rest at home or with clients. However, some firms are ordering staff to be ready to return to the office when restrictions are lifted, including the US banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Top and bottom areas The ONS said the share of people doing their jobs remotely had fluctuated in line with government restrictions, with as many as 46.6% of employees reporting in April 2020 that they had worked from home at some point during the first lockdown. This fell to a low of 27% in August as restrictions were relaxed and the government urged people to return to work, before rising sharply back to 47% in early February this year as the pandemic worsened. Chris Shine, a policy analyst at the ONS, said: As the country emerges again from lockdown, it is too soon to say how permanent or widespread these changes will prove to be, with many commentators talking about hybrid forms of working in which employees attend a central workplace, but less often than in the past.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2023\/jan\/08\/social-care-reforms-homes-hospitals-discharge-patients-councils","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/jan\/08\/social-care-reforms-homes-hospitals-discharge-patients-councils","DATE":"2023-01-08 13:23:31","PLAIN_TEXT":"Last Thursday, I spoke to a hospital doctor based in north-east England working in acute medicine, a catch-all term that takes in most conditions that present as emergencies, from heart attacks to kidney failure. I was put in touch with her by EveryDoctor, the advocacy group for medical professionals set up just before the pandemic. Ive never seen anything like this, she told me. The corridors are crammed with people on trolleys, being nursed. Our A&amp;E department is twice the size it was before the pandemic, but its just silted up with people who cant get beds. What had tipped her hospital into crisis, she said, was a bad flu season and a sharp rise in respiratory viruses, coupled with deep systemic problems that had been festering for years. She explained her fears in the apparently unruffled tones of someone who regularly deals with matters of life and death, but what she said was full of foreboding, with a sense that a basic foundation of the social contract had fallen away. I think most people would say that if they were really ill, when they got through the doors, theyd be as safe as they could be. It feels like thats not the case now ... Theres just too much jeopardy. There was one particularly telling aspect of our conversation. It regularly flipped from the state of the NHS into the equally dire condition of the adult social care administered by councils and largely delivered by private providers, and a fundamental issue that hangs over this winter: the reality of an increasingly ageing society, and how little has been done to prepare for it. Low pay, high staff turnover and ongoing austerity remain the defining features of how we deal with societys care needs, and gaping holes in provision have one particularly tragic result: patients who ought to be discharged from hospital being stranded there. If social care was halfway adequate, moreover, many older people might not be hospitalised in the first place. Clearly, one crisis is inseparable from the other. According to the president of Royal College of Emergency Medicine, as many as 13,000 NHS patients - who account for up to 13% of hospital beds - are medically ready to leave hospital, but have to stay because there is nowhere else for them to go. My doctor contacts estimate of numbers in her hospital chimed with that figure, and she also told me that bed-blocking rooted in poor social care was currently her colleagues single biggest problem: If that issue was sorted, we might be able to manage. In human terms, moreover, the problem is tragic: Theres a great deal of misery in people being stuck on a ward. It certainly delays their recovery. Beyond a certain point, nobody gets better in hospital. In recent months, she went on, it has become difficult to even get care packages for people in the advanced stages of terminal illness. In the past, if I saw a patient who had advanced cancer and wanted to go home to die, we can get that set up. Now that often cant happen, because the home care just isnt there. Journalists and politicians in England tend to fixate on the huge care bills paid by more affluent households, and the proposed funding reforms now delayed until 2025. But what of the state of social care itself? Thanks partly to rising energy costs, record numbers of care homes are going bust. In the first three months of last year, the Care and Quality Commission reported that more than two million annual hours of home care could not be delivered because of an inadequate workforce. By the late summer, credible figures suggested that nearly 300,000 people in England were waiting for an assessment of their care needs, with 600 people a day joining waiting lists. The backstory to all this is depressingly familiar: the reckless austerity pursued by David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg, and how it flew in the face of rising need. I first heard people in local government talking about social care cuts blocking hospital beds eight years ago. More recently, sporadic-but-inadequate pots of money have been accompanied by equally sporadic talk of reform, but no sense of anyone managing to arrest snowballing failures. Over the weekend, there was news of more emergency spending - hundreds of millions of pounds, said the front page of the Sunday Times - to block-buy places in care homes and free up NHS beds, on top of the PS500m already allotted to a new discharge fund. These moves might be welcome, but there is no strategic coherence: they leave the underlying factors behind the crisis untouched. On Sunday morning, Laura Kuenssberg asked the prime minister the right question: Would you do a job as a care worker for PS18,000 a year? He did not answer. About 50% of people in the sector earn within 30p an hour of the minimum wage. Brexit simmers away in the background, as both one cause of the sectors mounting labour shortages, and the trigger of more indirect effects: increased vacancies in other fields are pulling people away from care in ever-greater numbers. In 2021 the vacancy rate in adult social care was 5.9%; a year later, it reached 10%. Looking ahead, we will clearly need ever-increasing numbers of people to staff the care system, but the current number of unfilled posts in the sector stands at about 165,000. Related: Complained about neglect in a care home and faced a visiting ban? This is the new normal | Helen Wildbore Notwithstanding the culpability of Westminster politicians for so much of this mess, these problems run across the UK, and are now receiving different and very belated answers. In the teeth of loud opposition, the SNP government in Scotland is trying to centralise provision into a new national care service; in England, Labour offers vague talk of a countrywide system that would take shape over several parliaments, while Tory ministers hype up the Health and Care Act of 2022 as a historic shift in how health and care services work together. But there is one argument you hear time and again from social care insiders: that before we get to any big conversations about sweeping change, the urgency of our current crises needs to be eased by quickly paying people more, and putting a teetering system on a stable footing. Contrary to what we hear from both Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, there is no immediate way out of this mess that does not involve large amounts of money, spent year after year, and a plentiful supply of care workers. There are two viable ways to secure those things: a growing economy that will bring in sufficient tax revenue, and a genuinely welcoming approach to people from overseas. But we are not that kind of country any more, for reasons that barely need mentioning. Encouraged by the self-same charlatans who now wail about a broken Britain, the vote to leave the EU among the over-65s came in at 64%. That grim irony is one more element of a winter characterised by chaos and carnage, and one symbolic image that still seems overlooked: people nearing the end of their lives, stuck on hospital wards, hanging on to a dimming hope that they may somehow make it home.

Clothes and childrens toys were scattered over the paths between the burned-out buildings, many of which had massive holes where shells had smashed through. I lived in the same Saltivka neighbourhood my whole life. And now its just gone, it is a horror show. Saltivka - a Soviet-era, working-class development project initially intended for the citys industrial workers and their families - was home to around 600,000 people before the war, making it one of the largest neighbourhoods in Europe. Though admittedly cramped, it was full of energy, Marchenko recalled. Interactive But since the start of Russias invasion four months ago, Saltivka, which lies in the north-east of the city, has borne the brunt of Moscows relentless shelling of Ukraines second-biggest city. Now, the neighbourhood feels like a ghost town. Marchenko, like many others, left Kharkiv - just 25 miles from the Russian border - with her husband in the early days of the war as enemy tanks threatened to overrun the city. But she returned this month, encouraged by reports from friends and officials that shelling was winding down following a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive that has pushed Russian forces away from the outskirts of the city. Others emerged from the nearby underground metro stations that were turned into shelters where they had spent weeks living. Collectively, they are now trying to navigate their lives in the most damaged neighbourhood of Kharkiv. Many residents in Saltivka do not have access to gas, electricity or running water, and Marchenko is now forced to carry large bottles of water up to her apartment. At least I am staying fit, but this is not how I was imagining my pension, said Marchenko, who worked for 30 years at the local post office. Yet she calls herself one of the lucky ones. Her apartment was left largely untouched, apart from the small pieces of shrapnel that broke her windows and remained scattered around her home when she returned. Walking around Saltivka, the sheer randomness of Russias strikes quickly becomes apparent - one block hit, the next left untouched, one apartment turned to ruins, the next undamaged. Just below Marchenko, on the ninth floor, a Russian MLR rocket obliterated the flat of her neighbour and lifelong friend Nastia. Look at that, Marchenko said as she walked one floor down to show a large round hole in what was once Nastias living room. This is where our children grew up together. All of those memories are gone. Tatyana Marchenko in her flat, with its shattered windows, in Saltivka. Photograph: Pjotr SauerThe Observer Some families have lost their homes or are remaining underground because they are still too frightened of Russian attacks. At the Heroiv Pratsi (Heroes of Labour) metro station in the north of Saltivka, around 100 people, mostly women and children, are still hiding, despite the subway reopening earlier this month. To make matters worse, the relative calmness that prompted Marchenko and others to return was, in the end, deceptive. Over the past week, Kharkiv has experienced some of the worst Russian shelling it has seen to date, killing more than 15 people, as worries grow in Kyiv that Russia is now mounting another attack on the city. Russian forces are just a few miles away from Saltivka, and from her flat, Marchenko could see Ukrainian troops rearranging their positions in the forest that borders the neighbourhood. Throughout the day, sounds of explosions were audible in the background, but many in Saltivka now simply shrug, unimpressed and largely familiar with the threat of danger that no longer keeps them up at night. Somewhere on the front line was Marchenkos son, she said, pointing to a small shrine she had made for him in her flat. My son was not a killer and wasnt planning to sign up to fight. But something changed in him after he saw that Russians were bombing ordinary civilians, she said. Im so glad hes defending our country. Saltivka is arguably the most powerful testimony contradicting Russias repeated claims that its military does not target civilian infrastructure. At first, we thought Russia was just getting the wrong intelligence, thinking our soldiers could be hiding in civilian buildings, said Sergei Bolvinov, head of the investigative department at the Kharkiv regions police force. But now we see this was always the plan - to target civilian infrastructure. In total, he said, around 2,000 high-rise buildings had been severely damaged in the city, many of which will not be repaired. Saltivka, especially its north, is destroyed completely. Victoria is wearing a princess dress as she celebrates her 10th birthday with others sheltering in the metro station. Photograph: Jelle KringsThe Observer Not far from Marchenkos house lies the devastated Barabashova market. Before the war, it was the biggest market in Europe and one of the busiest. Some of the few shops that remain open on the abandoned, rubbish-infested passageway there sell flowers. There is no romance left in here, but we have funerals, said Anastasia, who ran a flower shop of the same name. Anastasia said that just the day before Russia launched its invasion, she made a massive order of Dutch tulips from the Netherlands for 8 March, International Womens Day. Ever since the days of the Soviet Union, the day has been widely celebrated in both Russia and Ukraine, with men often spending a fortune on flowers for their wives, mothers and sisters. Now the tulips were mostly rotting away. Tulips are not for funerals. Families of fallen soldiers only want lilies. Anastasia said she was still kicking herself for the tulip order, adding that virtually no one in the largely Russian-speaking city could have imagined its big neighbour would actually invade their country. I am still thinking every day: should I have seen it coming? Should I have placed that order? Being so close to the border meant that many in Kharkiv, like Anastasia, whose uncle lived in Russia, had developed extensive cultural and family ties with their neighbour. Families living in the Heroiv Pratsi station. Photograph: Jelle KringsJelle Kringsthe Observer The war has served as a decisive break between the city and Moscow. Everything changed on 24 February, and there is no going back now, said Bolvinov, the local police chief who now refuses to speak Russian at work. On Wednesday, Kharkivs largest university announced that it was closing its Russian literature department, reorganising it into the Department of Slavic Philology. The city is also planning to rename more than 200 streets or squares that celebrate Russian artists, writers and historical figures. For many in Saltivka, the symbolic moves have made little difference to their daily struggle to survive and keep on going. And most of them remained grimly pessimistic about the prospects of the war ending anytime soon. Who knows for how long this will go on? And we cant live like this much longer, said Artyom Belousov, 45, who stayed in Saltivka throughout the war to care for his mother who has dementia. The fighting in Ukraine has turned into a bloody war of attrition, with both sides making few strategic advances. Western leaders have started to warn that it might take years before the war winds down. And local officials fear that even if Ukraine manages to push the invading army out of the country, Russia will still be able to fire rockets from the city of Belgorod, just across the border. Belousov, dragging on a cigarette, said he tried not to think of the difficult months that lay ahead. What if the winter comes, and we still dont have any heating?

The new health secretary is examining proposals to pay care homes in England to look after patients who are medically fit to leave hospital but cannot be discharged because of a lack of social care. Officials at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) believe the scheme could tackle two major NHS problems at once, by freeing up some of the 13,000 hospital beds currently occupied by delayed discharge patients and improving handovers by ambulance crews to A&amp;E staff. Related: Therese Coffey: convivial pragmatist inherits health service in crisis If approved, the plan would become a key element of the strategy that ministers are expected to set out next week to address the multiple problems affecting the NHS, including long delays for A&amp;E, GP and cancer care and hospital beds. In her inaugural speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street on Tuesday, Liz Truss identified the NHS as one of her three early priorities. I will make sure that people can get doctors appointments and the NHS services they need. We will put our health service on a firm footing, Truss pledged, though she gave no details. However, whether the scheme becomes a reality depends on the Treasury agreeing to cover the costs, which DHSC sources put at several hundred million pounds. Neither the DHSC nor NHS England have enough money in reserve to do so, it is understood. It would in effect see the government starting to once again pay for the NHS to operate a discharge to assess scheme, funding for which was ended in March despite NHS organisations warning that it would make it harder for hospitals to free up beds. The DHSC began examining the pros and cons involved in reviving that initiative under Coffeys predecessor, Steve Barclay. Coffey and NHS leaders are keen to do everything they can to reduce the pressure on the NHS, especially acute hospitals, before what they fear could be a winter in which the service falls over. She is also studying plans for the NHS 111 telephone advice service to increase the proportion of patients with minor ailments it refers to a pharmacist, to reduce the strain on GP surgeries. NHS England would foot the estimated PS100m bill for that initiative, which would see an expansion of the community pharmacy consultation service set up in 2019. Coffey, who Truss has also made deputy prime minister, is expected to set out plans to stop senior doctors being hit with huge pension tax bills, which have prompted some doctors to reduce their working hours or retire early. Truss has pledged to solve the problem so that doctors can work longer hours to help tackle the 6.7 million-strong NHS care backlog. NHS leaders were disappointed when the previous discharge to assess funding ended, despite their pleas, said Rory Deighton, the acute lead at the NHS Confederation. During the first wave of coronavirus it freed up 30,000 hospital beds, led to a 28% drop in patients staying in hospital for more than three weeks, freed up more than 6,000 staff, and led to PS451m of efficiency savings. If the approach was revived then funding would have to be long-term rather than a one-off, he said, in order to help the NHS run smoothly and allow patients to recover in the most suitable places for them.

Greater Sydney reopened at 12:01 am on Monday as stay-at-home orders were lifted across NSW. This comes after the state reached its milestone of 70% of the over-16 population fully vaccinated last week. Gyms, cafes, restaurants, pools, shops, hairdressers and beauticians can now reopen, people can have 10 people over to their home, gather in groups of 30 people outdoors in public, and travel more than 5km from their home. But these new freedoms are only available to the fully vaccinated and those who have a medical exemption. 10.13pm BST Here is a round up of todays key Covid-19 lines: UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries has warned that people who catch flu and Covid at the same time this winter are twice as likely to die than those who only have coronavirus. Harries also said that its hard to predict what the next chapter of the pandemic will look like in the UK, as immunity from vaccines wanes among older people. More than 2 million people have been given the coronavirus booster jab in England so far. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, expects the countrys Covid pass, working from home, and the mask mandate to continue into next year. Police in Italy arrested 12 people including the leaders of the far-right Forza Nuova party on Sunday, following clashes in Rome a day earlier over government attempts to make Italys Covid-19 Green Pass mandatory for all workers. Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the man regarded as the father of Pakistans nuclear bomb, has died at 85 after being hospitalised with Covid-19. The prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, backed plans to fast-track the resumption of international travel as soon as New South Wales home quarantine program is ready. Sydney is opening up on Monday after over 100 days in lockdown. Malaysia on Sunday lifted interstate and international travel restrictions for residents fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as the country achieved its target of inoculating 90% of the adult population, Reuters reports.

Egypts public prosecution office - which is responsible for investigating criminal complaints - said on Sunday it had ordered the arrest after 18,400 vaccine packages valued at over 5 million Egyptian pounds ($319,000) were reported missing. An inventory check showed that an additional 5,000 vaccine packages were also missing from Minyas health directorate after being stored at improper temperatures, the prosecution office said. It is unclear what type of vaccines the packages contained, but an earlier statement from Egyptian authorities said they were Sinopharm. 8.16pm BST New research shows Covid-19 has exacerbated the gap in life expectancy between Englands richest and poorest people. The difference in expected lifespan between some of the wealthiest and poorest areas across the country has more than doubled since the early 2000s, a Guardian analysis of data by the Kings Fund shows. Coronavirus has exacerbated Englands north-south divide and the deprivation divide in life expectancy, said Veena Raleigh, an epidemiologist at Kings Fund who studies health inequalities. The new data follows a report from last week by a group of doctors, statisticians and NHS leaders, which found that male and female life expectancy fell by 1.3 years and 0.9 years respectively in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. 7.27pm BST After over 100 days of lockdown, millions of vaccinated Sydney residents will emerge from their homes on Monday and be welcomed into restaurants, gyms, beauty salons and public pools. 72.8% of people aged 16 and over are now fully-vaccinated in New South Wales.

Federal employees are required to show proof of their full vaccination status in Canada by the end of the month, or theyll face unpaid leave, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday. One long-term care home in Toronto was forced to put 36% of its workforce on unpaid leave last week because they were still unvaccinated, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Federal employees make up roughly 8% of Canadas total workforce according to the countrys Treasury. Starting Monday, British Columbia will be the latest Canadian province to begin placing healthcare staff on administrative leave if they havent received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Update: Federal public servants must confirm their vaccination status by October 29th. Those who are not willing to disclose their status, and those who are not willing to be fully vaccinated, will be placed on administrative leave without pay as early as November 15th.&mdash; Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) October 6, 2021 Updated at 6.51pm BST 6.10pm BST Russia will temporarily suspend test-firing rocket engines in one of the countrys space manufacturing plants to save oxygen supplies for Covid-19 patients, Reuters reports. At various stages throughout the pandemic liquid oxygen has been redirected from rocket launch pads and design centres to boost hospital supplies. In view of growing demand for medical oxygen to treat the sick, today we decided to suspend test firing rocket engines at Voronezhs Chemical Automatics Design Bureau ranges until the end of the month,Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russias space agency tweeted.

If you think Im missing anything, please get in touch via the comments section below. 4.08pm BST Here is a round up of the day so far: People who catch flu and Covid at the same time this winter are twice as likely to die than those who only have coronavirus, according to the UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries. Harries said it is not the case that 120 deaths a day in the UK is seen as an acceptable death rate for Covid and added the difficulty now is in predicting what is to come with Covid-19, as immunity from vaccines wanes in some older people. More than 2 million people have been given the coronavirus booster jab in England so far. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, expects the countrys Covid pass, working from home, and the mask mandate to continue into next year. The policymaker Michael Saunders has added to signs the Bank of England might become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Police in Italy said on Sunday they had arrested 12 people including the leaders of the extreme right-wing party Forza Nuova, after clashes in Rome a day earlier over a government drive to make the Covid-19 Green Pass mandatory for all workers. Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the man regarded as the father of Pakistans nuclear bomb, has died aged 85 after being hospitalised with Covid-19. The prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, has backed plans to fast-track the resumption of international travel as soon as New South Wales home quarantine program is ready. Malaysia on Sunday lifted interstate and international travel restrictions for residents fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as the country achieved its target of inoculating 90% of its adult population, Reuters reports. 3.08pm BST Anti-vax protest in Italy sees leaders of the countrys far-right arrested Italian police said on Sunday they had arrested 12 people including the leaders of the extreme right-wing party Forza Nuova, after clashes in Rome a day earlier over a government drive to make the Covid-19 Green Pass mandatory for all workers, Reuters reports. Draghi introduced the pass - a digital or paper certificate confirming its holder has either received at least one vaccine dose, has tested negative or has recently recovered from the virus - in the summer to help prevent infections and encourage people to get vaccinated. The certificates were initially needed to enter many cultural and leisure venues, but their scope has gradually been widened. Last month, the government made it compulsory for all workers. Thousands of people took to the streets of the Italian capital on Saturday to oppose the move. Some tried to break past police in riot gear guarding access to Prime Minister Mario Draghis office, while a separate group broke into the headquarters of Italys main CGIL trade union and turned its offices upside down. Overnight, dozens of protesters also tried to break into the accident and emergency unit at Romes Policlinico Umberto I hospital, where one of them was being kept for treatment, forcing health workers to barricade themselves inside, emergency department head Francesco Pugliese told reporters on Sunday. It was a fascist squad attack, and it is unacceptable, CGILs head Maurizio Landini said on Sunday, speaking to supporters in front of the union offices in Rome. The riots drew widespread condemnation, including from Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, the leaders of the rightist League and Brothers of Italy parties, respectively. The police said in a statement that 38 police officers were injured during the Rome anti-vax clashes. More than 80% of all Italians over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated as of 10 October. Updated at 7.39pm BST 2.14pm BST Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, was doing media rounds this morning. My colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson has covered the key points from her appearances. She writes: People who catch flu and Covid at the same time this winter are twice as likely to die than those who only have coronavirus, according to the UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries. The former deputy chief medical officer for England warned that the UK faces an uncertain winter - with both flu and Covid-19 circulating for the first time - and urged people to take up both the coronavirus and flu jabs if eligible. Asked how worried the public should be about flu this winter, she told Skys Trevor Phillips On Sunday: We should be worried about flu each winter. I think people still dont realise it can be a fatal disease. But I think the important thing about this winter is, we are likely to see flu, for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with Covid. So the risks of catching both together still remain. And if you do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together than just having Covid alone. So I think its an uncertain winter ahead - thats not a prediction, its an uncertain feature - but we do know that flu cases have been lower in the previous year so immunity and the strain types are a little more uncertain, she said.

Speaking to Tom Swarbrick on LBC on Sunday he said: Mask-wearing in crowded public places, continuing to ask people to work from home, a Covid pass for high-risk locations - that is the suite of measures we hope will see us through this autumn and winter without needing to do anything else, but I do expect they will continue into the early part of next year. Updated at 2.15pm BST 1.09pm BST The policymaker Michael Saunders has added to signs the Bank of England might become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Saunders has warned households to get ready for significantly earlier interest rate rises as inflation pressure mounts in the British economy. Saunders said investors were right to bet on faster increases in borrowing costs with consumer price inflation on course to rise above 4%, adding to signs the Bank might become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Im not in favour of using code words or stating our intentions in advance of the meeting too precisely. The decisions get taken at the proper time, Saunders said in a an interview with the Telegraph. But markets have priced in over the last few months an earlier rise in Bank rate than previously and I think thats appropriate. Read more here: Bank of England official warns of potential early interest rate rise Updated at 1.14pm BST 11.45am BST Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the man regarded as the father of Pakistans nuclear bomb, has died aged 85 after being hospitalised with Covid-19, the BBC reports. Khan was hailed as a national hero for transforming his country into the worlds first Islamic nuclear power. But he was also notorious for having smuggled nuclear secrets to states including North Korea and Iran. Prime Minister Imran Khan said Pakistan had lost a national icon. 11.23am BST Italy has reached the target of fully vaccinating 80% of the population over the age of 12 against Covid-19, according to official data, achieving a goal Rome had set as a safety cut-off point, Reuters reports. According to a government website showed 43,229,551 people over-12, out of a total population of around 60 million, had completed their vaccination cycle as of 10 October. The 80% target was set by special commissioner for the Covid emergency, Gen Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, in March and was hit late on 9 October. Thats a critical level above which experts say - and the trend weve been recording for weeks confirms this - that the risk of hospitalisation is drastically reduced, the commissioners office said. Italy was a harbinger for Europe in the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020 with the rest of the continent watching on in horror as they realised what was unfolding in Italy was soon to befall on their own shores. Updated at 12.56pm BST 11.01am BST 120 deaths a day not an &quot;acceptable death rate&quot; - UK health chief Staying with Dr Jenny Harries, she said it is not the case that 120 deaths a day is seen as an acceptable death rate for Covid. She told The Andrew Marr Show: Clearly weve got large vaccination programmes ongoing, weve got significant testing. This isnt how we normally treat an endemic disease so I think the answer to that is very clearly no. Were taking it extremely seriously. But it is important to remember that for an average flu season its about 11,000 deaths a year - its somewhere between four [thousand] to 22,000 over the last four to five years. So we are starting to move to a situation where, perhaps Covid is not the most significant element and many of those individuals affected will of course have other comorbidities which will make them vulnerable to serious illness for other reasons as well. Updated at 12.56pm BST 10.40am BST Staying with the UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, she told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One that the difficulty now is in predicting what is to come with Covid-19, as immunity from vaccines wanes in some older people. She said: Weve obviously had extremely good vaccine uptake and that is now preventing very significant amounts of hospitalisation and death. She added: Probably the difficulty is at this point in the pandemic, its one of the most difficult times to predict what will come. We have different levels of vaccination, we have a little bit of immunity waning in older individuals, which is why were now starting to put in a Covid booster vaccine. We have slightly different effectiveness in different vaccinations that have been provided. 10.16am BST The UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, has said that this year there could be a multi-strain flu and encouraged everyone who is eligible to ensure they take up the offer of both their coronavirus and flu jabs. She told Sky: The difference here is because we have, if you like, skipped a year almost with flu, its possible we might see multi-strain flu. We usually get one strain predominating. We look to the southern hemisphere, who hits winter sooner than we do. We work with WHO [the World Health Organization] and then take JCVI [the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] advice to know which strains to include in the vaccine each year, and there are four in there. So weve got a pretty good array in our toolbox to try and hit whichever one becomes dominant but it could be more than one this year, and peoples immunity will be lower. So I think the real trick here is to get vaccinated - in both Covid and flu - but obviously to continue to do those good hygiene behaviours that weve been practising all through Covid. Updated at 12.57pm BST 9.59am BST UK faces uncertain winter says Jenny Harries The UK faces an uncertain winter, with the presence of both flu and Covid-19, a health chief has said. The UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, said there is lower immunity to flu this year. Asked how worried the public should be about flu this winter, she told Skys Trevor Phillips On Sunday: We should be worried about flu each winter. I think people still dont realise it can be a fatal disease. Recent studies suggest that about 25% of us dont actually understand that. On average, over the last five years, about 11,000 people have died with flu-related conditions. But I think the important thing about this winter is, we are likely to see flu, for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with Covid. So the risks of catching both together still remain. And if you do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together, than just having Covid alone. So I think its an uncertain winter ahead - thats not a prediction its an uncertain feature - but we do know that flu cases have been lower in the previous year so immunity and the strain types are a little more uncertain. Updated at 12.57pm BST 9.43am BST Malaysia on Sunday lifted interstate and international travel restrictions for residents fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as the country achieved its target of inoculating 90% of its adult population, Reuters reports. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government has agreed to allow fully vaccinated Malaysians to travel overseas without applying for permission. The new rules take effect on Monday. The government is preparing to shift into an endemic Covid-19 phase where it will not impose wide lockdowns again if cases rise, Ismail Sabri told a news conference. Updated at 12.57pm BST 9.17am BST The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has backed plans to fast-track the resumption of international travel as soon as New South Wales home quarantine program is ready. In a Facebook livestream on Sunday, the prime minister said he had had discussions with NSW premier Dominic Perrottet about bringing forward the start date of international travel for fully vaccinated people. Morrison has previously said states would be allowed to reopen to international travellers in mid-November once their 80% vaccination targets had been met. His comments come after Perrottet said earlier on Sunday that he wanted to resume international travel as quickly as possible, flagging that a home quarantine program for fully-vaccinated people could begin as soon as the end of this month.

The unrest comes as Cignas profits in 2020 increased to $8.5bn from $5.1bn in 2019. David Cordani, the CEO of Cigna, received nearly $79m in compensation in 2020, a raise of $13.4m from the previous year. In March 2021, Cigna announced plans to increase expenditures on stock buybacks to $8bn over the next four years. Cigna is closing offices around the US, switching several positions and departments to remote work permanently. Related: Up to 43m Americans could lose health insurance amid pandemic, report says Several months ago, workers started an online petition demanding Cigna improve working conditions, including lifting a pay raise freeze, stopping constant harassment of workers to meet production metrics and providing a way for workers to report abusive callers. Customer management requires us to handle phone calls within a specific amount of time, said a call representative at Cigna in the midwest who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. The numbers are hardcore. Theyre constantly on you about them and to me, that doesnt really meet the customers needs. The phone call metrics could go down if customer service advocates were trained better and we had better resources. The worker explained they often receive phone calls from customers who have called repeatedly without any resolution to their problem, and that they are constantly being monitored by apps and prompted to move on to the next call. I always get pressured on every end. There were days that I would almost be in tears before I would even log in for work, I just mentally, emotionally and physically cannot handle that anymore, the representative added. There were times when I was the sixth customer service advocate that theyve talked to in the last couple of weeks, and nothing is getting resolved. Nothing. This is a customer who has called multiple times and theyre upset. This is their health insurance. This is something thats important. And when you cant resolve it for either lack of training or lack of time because youre having to meet metrics, that gets old. A second customer service advocate in the midwest explained a whole new set of issues arose once the Covid-19 pandemic hit and workers were allowed to work from home. Paid time off was taken from workers for any technical issues they experienced while working remotely, and staff handled a huge volume of calls from customers irritated about the delays in processing Covid-19 testing reimbursement claims. A customer service advocate at Cigna said a new set of issues arose once the Covid-19 pandemic hit and workers were allowed to work from home. Photograph: Bryan WoolstonAP The process was unbelievable. It could have been six months before reimbursement and it was going to be in a multitude of checks. Were given 15 minutes to make outbound phone calls to doctor offices, provider offices, and they get taken away because of the call volume metrics, the worker said. The numbers are constantly driven down your throat. Email, after email, after email - check your numbers, make sure you hit your numbers and everything. Our manager would post our numbers daily so everybody on your team knows whether or not youre meeting your metrics. In addition to the increased workloads and frustrating processes, the worker explained that customer service advocates did not receive a raise this year. After a year of Covid, and all of us making adjustments for Covid and everything. They were like, Well, sorry, youre not getting a raise, you know, youre just out of luck this year, one worker said. Workers said human resources held focus groups in response to the online petition, but that nothing has changed. Several workers have quit. Burnout is very high and these jobs, the metrics they have to meet in many cases are impossible to meet, particularly if theyre talking to a health plan enrollee who has a complicated case. But theyre on the clock and theres an expectation they will handle a certain number of calls in a day, said Wendell Potter, who worked at Cigna from 1993 until he retired in 2008 as vice president of corporate communications and became a whistleblower on the industry. Potter added: You have to deal with people who are in a difficult spot and in many cases angry, trying to figure out their health plan, benefits and why something was denied or why they had to get prior authorization for something. In my view, its one of the most stressful jobs in a health insurance company. Jordyn Emeree, who worked as a call representative at Cigna in Illinois for two years, quit last month over the stressful working conditions and because she says a manager discriminated against her for being a transgender woman, telling her that she shouldnt expect everyone at work to accept her transition. In the two years being with Cigna I never got a bonus as were supposed to get one every quarter. I had to fight for my yearly raise last year as it was not given to me, said Emeree. They let the members emotionally abuse us and we cant do anything about it besides wait for a supervisor to become available to take the call. A Cigna spokesperson declined to comment on any individual complaint, but said in an email, Cigna takes all feedback seriously, including external petitions such as this one. We have a wide range of tools to ensure our employees voices are heard. We regularly survey all employees covering topics like workload, conditions, and stress, host town halls, conduct focus groups, and actively encourage our managers to have open and honest discussions with their teams about how we can better support our colleagues. Were proud of the culture weve created, but know theres always room to improve, so appreciate all feedback we receive.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2021\/may\/23\/workers-government-covid-pandemic-lessons-biden-trump-vaccines","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2021\/may\/23\/workers-government-covid-pandemic-lessons-biden-trump-vaccines","DATE":"2021-05-23 05:00:20","PLAIN_TEXT":"Maybe its wishful thinking to declare the pandemic over in the US, and presumptuous to conclude what lessons weve learned. So consider this a first draft. Related: Indias suffering isnt just the fault of a new Covid variant | Rukmini S 1. Workers are always essential We couldnt have survived without millions of warehouse, delivery, grocery and hospital workers literally risking their lives. Yet most of these workers are paid squat. Amazon touts its $15 minimum wage but it totals only about $30,000 a year. Most essential workers dont have health insurance or paid leave. Many of their employers (including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, to take but two examples) didnt give them the personal protective equipment they needed. Lesson: Essential workers deserve far better. 2. Healthcare is a basic right You know how you got your vaccine without paying a dime? Thats how all healthcare could be. Yet too many Americans who contracted Covid-19 got walloped with humongous hospital bills. By mid-2020, about 3.3 million people had lost employer-sponsored coverage and the number of uninsured had increased by 1.9 million. Research by the Urban Institute found that people with chronic disease, Black Americans and low-income children were most likely to have delayed or foregone care during the pandemic. Lesson: America must insure everyone. 3. Conspiracy theories can be deadly Last June, about one in four Americans believed the pandemic was definitely or probably created intentionally, according to the Pew Research Center. Other conspiracy theories have caused some people to avoid wearing masks or getting vaccinated, resulting in unnecessary illness or death. Lesson: An informed public is essential. Some of the responsibility falls on all of us. Some of it on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms that allowed misinformation to flourish. 4. The stock market isnt the economy The stock market rose throughout the pandemic, lifting the wealth of the richest 1% who own half of all stock owned by Americans. Meanwhile, from March 2020 to February 2021 80 million in the US lost their jobs. Between June and November 2020, nearly 8 million fell into poverty. Black and Latino adults were more than twice as likely as white adults to report not having enough to eat: 16% each for Black and Latino adults, compared to 6% of white adults. Lesson: Stop using the stock market as a measure of economic wellbeing. Look instead at the percentage of Americans who are working, and their median pay. 5. Wages are too low to get by on Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. So once the pandemic hit, many didnt have any savings to fall back on. Conservative lawmakers complain that the extra $300 a week unemployment benefit Congress enacted in March discourages people from working. Whats really discouraging them is lack of childcare and lousy wages. Lesson: Raise the minimum wage, strengthen labor unions and push companies to share profits with their workers. 6. Remote work is now baked into the economy The percentage of workers punching in from home hit a high of 70% in April 2020. A majority still work remotely. Some 40% want to continue working from home. Two lessons: Companies will have to adjust. And much commercial real estate will remain vacant. Why not convert it into affordable housing? 7. Billionaires arent the answer The combined wealth of Americas 657 billionaires grew by $1.3tn - or 44.6% - during the pandemic. Jeff Bezos, with $183.9bn, became the richest man in the world. Larry Page, a co-founder of Google, added $11.8bn to his $94.3bn fortune. Sergey Brin, Googles other co-founder, added $11.4bn. Yet billionaires taxes are lower than ever. Wealthy Americans today pay one-sixth the rate of taxes their counterparts paid in 1953. Lesson: To afford everything the nation needs, raise taxes at the top. 8. Government can be the solution Related: Republican Covid lies follow foreign strongmens lead - and are deadly for it | Robert Reich Ronald Reagans famous quip - Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem - can now officially be retired. Trumps Operation Warp Speed succeeded in readying vaccines faster than most experts thought possible. Biden got them into more arms more quickly than any vaccination program in history. Furthermore, the $900bn in aid Congress passed in late December prevented millions from losing unemployment benefits and helped sustain the recovery when it was faltering. The $1.9tn Democrats pushed through in March will help the US achieve something it failed to achieve after the 2008-09 recession: a robust recovery. Lesson: The federal government did not just help beat the pandemic. It also did more to keep the nation afloat than in any previous recession. It must be prepared to do so again.

In the short time that he has been in the public eye, the 34-year-old Republican congressman from New York has been accused of fabricating almost every facet of his life. During his election campaign, Santos claimed to be a proud American Jew whose grandparents survived the Holocaust. After being challenged on this, however, Santos clarified that he was raised Catholic and argued that he had always said he was Jew-ish. Emphasis on the ish. What else has he lied about? Well, how long have you got? His education and work history appear to be fabrications. He has said his mother was working in the World Trade Center on 911, yet records show she was in Brazil. He has said that he lost four employees in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida, but the New York Times has not been able to verify these claims. He has also claimed to have been a college volleyball star (unlikely) and a producer on Spider-Man (untrue). No one is even sure what Santoss real name is. I could go on and on with the lies, but I need to get to the scandals. There is the scandal about his former life as a drag queen in Brazil, which he originally denied, then appeared to admit. (To be clear: the only outrageous thing about his alleged drag-queen past is that he is now active in a party that demonises and wants to criminalise drag queens as part of a broader anti-LGBTQ+ agenda.) There is the $365,000 in campaign funds he cant account for. And then there are the multiple dog-related scandals. Last week, Politico reported allegations that Santos spent 2017 cruising around Pennsylvanias Amish Country buying puppies from dog breeders with cheques that bounced. (I know that cheques havent been widely used in the UK since about 1492, so this story sounds suspicious to British ears, but Americans still use them.) A few days after allegedly writing $15,125 in bad cheques to breeders, Santos held an adoption event at a pet store in New York. Its not clear if he made money from this, but adoption fees can range from $300 to $400. Santos was charged with theft by deception, but those charges were dropped when he claimed his chequebook had been stolen. The other dog-related scandal? The congressman is accused of promising to raise funds for a homeless mans dying dog in 2016, then taking off with the money. I am not sure how Santos still has a job as a lawmaker, but, as he becomes more and more of an embarrassment, his party colleagues are gradually turning against him. Fellow New York congressman Nick LaLota last week called Santos a sociopath. The Utah senator Mitt Romney, meanwhile, described Santos as a sick puppy and said he shouldnt be in Congress ... if he had any shame at all, he wouldnt be there. It turns out Santos doesnt have any shame. On Wednesday, he told reporters that he is the real victim. Its not the first time in history that Ive been told to shut up and go to the back of the room, especially by people who come from a privileged background, Santos said of Romneys remarks. I think its reprehensible the senator would say such a thing to me ... it wasnt very Mormon of him. If Santos were a one-off, his antics might be amusing. But there is nothing remotely funny about a political system that has allowed someone such as Santos to get as far as he has. Indeed, Santos may not be the only fabulist in the Republican party: the Washington Post reported last week that Representative Anna Paulina Luna, who was recently elected as a Republican congresswoman in Florida, also appears to have fabricated a lot of her biography. She, too, has claimed Jewish roots, but, according to her own family, her grandfather reportedly served in the armed forces of Nazi Germany. If true, these allegations would suggest that the only qualifications for a successful career in the Republican party are an active imagination and no moral compass whatsoever. * Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/sep\/27\/25000-wreck-25m-home-indoor-pool-three-house-sales-modern-britain","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/sep\/27\/25000-wreck-25m-home-indoor-pool-three-house-sales-modern-britain","DATE":"2022-09-27 05:00:14","PLAIN_TEXT":"Statistics tend to define the way we think about property. As a nation, we buy and sell more than 100,000 homes a month - more than 3,000 a day. House prices went up 7.8% in the year to June 2022, taking the average property value in the UK to PS286,397. The average deposit for first-time buyers is now about PS75,000. People aged over 65, who represent less than a quarter of the population, own almost half of Englands housing equity. But behind the numbers, each property transaction is a story with a cast of generally anxious characters. I set out to find properties worth PS25,000, PS250,000 and PS25m - and speak to everyone involved in each sale and purchase. Taken together, the stories of three very different houses offer a snapshot of an industry that shapes all our lives and communities. PS25,000 - Easington Colliery, County Durham When I tell my friends the prices of the properties Im selling, they cant believe places like this exist The house at the bottom of a street in Easington Colliery is in a sorry state. The windows have been boarded up, the front door padlocked shut. A rusting skip waits to be collected on the pavement. Inside, broken glass covers the carpets. Even the bannisters have been ripped out. Requires modernisation, the online listing had said. A couple of weeks before my visit in August, I watch six people bid for the three-bedroom house in an online auction. Russell Taylor, the managing director of Taylor James Auctions in Birmingham, says it is unlikely that any of them has even been to Easington Colliery, a coastal former mining town between Sunderland and Hartlepool. After 22 bids made over a few hours, the house sells for PS27,000 - slightly higher than the PS25,000 Taylor had predicted. She was overjoyed, he says of the buyer, a beauty salon owner from the Midlands (who prefers not to talk to me). The auctioneer says he sells more than 100 homes a year at about PS25,000, the majority of them in County Durham, which was once the countrys leading producer of coal. He works in a rarely scrutinised sector of the market, where homes can cost less than cars, and rental yields can seem hard to resist. When I tell my friends some of the values of the properties Im selling, they cant believe places like this exist, Taylor says. The boarded-up end-terrace house. Photograph: Christopher ThomondThe Guardian The street is one of Easington Collierys A streets (their names all starting with the letter A) of terrace miners cottages. They were laid out in rows off Seaside Lane, a high street that was extended east of the old village of Easington after the pit was sunk in 1899. There are clusters of B and C streets, too, each built around the site of the former colliery. Christine Wood lives a few doors up from the empty house. Her home of more than 40 years is immaculate. A painting of a pride of lions hangs above the mantelpiece, which supports porcelain figurines of siamese cats. Wood, who is 76, keeps her late husbands miners lamp on a dresser. She grew up in Easington, where her father was also a miner. It was lovely here back then, she says. All the miners were working and everybody cared about each other. Everyone looked after the houses and everything was clean. She cant remember if their rent was PS2 a week or a month. As many as 2,500 miners worked here for decades. There were two schools, a cinema and a brass brand. Easington was such an archetypal north-eastern colliery that the A streets served as the location for the 2000 film Billy Elliot. Yet the backdrop for the film - the 1984-85 miners strike - was the beginning of the end for the pit, starting a spiral of neglect that is still playing out on the street. The colliery gates shut in 1993. Today, a miners cage lift stands as a monument on cliffs overlooking the North Sea. Mining families were offered the chance to buy their homes for PS3,000. The Woods stayed put. But anybody who could get out did get out, says David Boyes, a driving instructor and Labour councillor for Easington Colliery. And that left the houses prey to unscrupulous landlords. Boyes, who is 59 and the grandson of a miner, says several terraces have been demolished, including the streets that appeared in Billy Elliot. Other houses were sold off in lots. Taylor says landlords are now a mix of businesspeople with several properties and sometimes naive opportunists. None of them, including a Nigerian oil executive living in the US, are keen to talk. Weve got landlords living in Dubai, in Ireland - all over, Boyes adds. Its all a bit mercenary. Graham (not his real name), an IT consultant from Surrey, bought the empty house more than 15 years ago as part of a batch of houses across the north-east. It was the worst decision I ever made, he says. The birth of the buy-to-let mortgage in 1996 had triggered a boom, as amateurs took advantage of cheap borrowing, high rental yields and soaring property prices. Many saw property as a smarter bet than a pension. If you had a reasonable income, you were able to borrow quite a lot with not very much scrutiny, Graham recalls. New landlords flocked to former mining towns. Auctions, which are standard at this level of the market, make it easy, Taylor says. The highest bidder exchanges contracts on the day, and generally youll have completed within 20 working days, he says. Spend another couple of thousand on a cheap refurbishment and find a lettings agent and you could very quickly be renting out a house for PS350 a month. But the symptoms of social deprivation are plain to see. Unemployment and crime levels are high. Wood, who has lived alone since her husband died in 2015, had to call the police after rocks were thrown at her windows. A man who answers the door next to the empty house describes the area as being like Beirut. He adds: There are three problems in this area - no work, nothing going on, and drugs. Boyes says the town now has about 70 heroin users registered for treatment. He says many tenants flit between houses, moving on as rent demands and utility bills start to pile up. We know for a fact that somebodys had a leaflet in Durham prison saying if you need a house, come to Easington because its so cheap, he says. Screengrab of a YouTube video showing the interior of the Easington Colliery house. Photograph: YouTube A cycle of vandalism and vanishing tenants meant Graham collected rent for about five months in the 15 years he owned the house. About five years ago I just decided not to spend any more money on it, he says. He sold the house at a loss, having spent thousands on refurbishments and repairs. Graham, who has made money on his other properties, is keen to defend landlords. I always took the approach that if you provide good homes for people, then its a public service, he says. There are a lot of shitty landlords out there, and Ive never wanted to be that. Boyes is bracing for winter as the cost of living crisis deepens. Demand at the local food bank has gone up by 350% so far this year, he says. Were going to protect people the best way we can. The council has invested in more CCTV cameras and this year introduced a selective licensing scheme, which legally requires landlords to maintain standards of homes and tenants. A community spirit still binds Easington Colliery. Last year, hundreds of villagers marched down Seaside Lane in memory of 83 men who died in a pit explosion in 1951. Most are buried in Easington Colliery cemetery, which sits next to what used to be known as the Withering Hope allotments. Mining heritage is embedded in this community and were determined not to lose it, Boyes says. On the street, Christine Wood is waiting to see who will move into the house on the corner. She sees little evidence of the old spirit as she goes to bed alone, fearing the crime on her doorstep. She has endured extraordinary loss: her mother and brother died in a motorbike crash when she was 12. Her son died by suicide when he was 29. She has lost her husband - and her community. She would move but her own house isnt worth much more than PS25,000, which wouldnt buy her a place anywhere else, or even pay rent for long. She says her faith is all she has left. I do still believe God is going to step in and put the Earth right, she says. In her lifetime? I hope so. PS250,000 - Didcot, Oxfordshire I looked at this plain red-brick house with a tiny garden and thought: how can this be worth a quarter of a million pounds? When Penny Cooke stepped on to the property ladder in her 20s, she remembers it being pretty easy. She had been leafing through the local paper when she spotted some flats being built in Didcot, the Oxfordshire town where she was born and lived. It was around 1980, and she bought her flat for about PS30,000. Average UK property prices were then about PS20,000. Average wages amounted to about PS4,000 a year. So the average worker could buy the average house for about five times their salary. I also bought the flat on a 110% mortgage, so all my moving fees were covered and I didnt even need a deposit, says Cooke. Her first job was at a milk bottling plant in Didcot, which was named a few years ago as, statistically speaking, the most average town in England. Cooke, who is now 63, continued up the housing ladder. In 2002, she bought a modest red-brick semi on a cul-de-sac in Didcot that is part of a sprawling estate built on farmland during the 70s. Many of its roads have aspirational names on a royal theme: Buckingham Close; Sandringham Road; Jubilee Way. Cooke loved the small two-bedroom house, where she lived alone, latterly with her greyhound, Honour. She added a small conservatory. But the pandemic, among other things, shifted her priorities. It was time to leave Didcot for a different pace of life on the Hebridean island of Mull. Warren Copping, a local estate agent at Hodsons, came to value the house last year. Cooke, who now works as a remote personal assistant, was stunned to learn it had doubled in price in less than 20 years. I looked at this plain red-brick house with a tiny garden in Didcot and thought: How can this be worth a quarter of a million pounds? she tells me from her new home. Yet, at the time, PS250,000 was the average house price in the UK (it has since risen to above PS280,000). Average wages, meanwhile, are now a little above PS30,000. So the average worker must now pay almost 10 times their salary for the average house. Id hate to be trying to get on the property ladder today, says Cooke. Michael Harkness and Carla Martinez with Amaya, at their new house in Didcot. Photograph: Sam FrostThe Guardian The house also seemed expensive to Michael Harkness and Carla Martinez, who are both 29. But after sinking more money in rent than they would care to calculate since they met in 2013, the couple were desperate to buy. At one point they had been paying PS1,050 a month for a one-bed flat in Brentwood, Essex - and then not much less for a room in a shared house on the edge of Reading. It just felt a bit pointless, Martinez says Harkness, who is a civil engineer, was working night shifts on the motorways to try to save up. Martinez, who grew up in a modest flat in Barcelona, was doing agency shifts on top of her full-time job as an NHS care assistant. The stakes then got even higher; after getting married last year, the couple had a baby, Amaya, in June. Almost half of first-time buyers rely on the bank of Mum and Dad, according to recent analysis by the estate agent Savills. We have this absurd situation where parents are lending money to kids who cant afford the prices the parents mates are charging for their homes, says Henry Pryor, a veteran estate agent and property expert. Beyond funds for a new fridge, neither Harkness nor Martinez had access to family money. A mortgage adviser set their maximum price at PS275,000, just under the PS282,000 average for first-time buyers in 2021, according to analysis by Barclays. They applied for a government help-to-buy Isa (now discontinued), which would give them an extra PS3,000 towards a house worth up to PS250,000 - if they could save up to PS12,000 themselves. Harkness started online searches for two-bedroom homes with good transport links not far from his workplace in Wokingham, Berkshire. Cookes house ticked lots of boxes, with a spare room upstairs for Amaya and space in the conservatory for a desk. They quickly made an offer. The Isa helped with the deposit, which the couple managed to negotiate down to PS20,000 - almost a third of the UK average for first-time buyers. Their mortgage payments of PS840 a month are only a little higher than their previous rent. They also escaped some of the effects of soaring inflation on mortgage deals, which are now making life even tougher for first-time buyers. Had we waited even a couple of months, it would have been a real struggle, Harkness says. Martinez was gleeful when she got the keys. It felt like such a big thing to have our own place. While its harder than ever to get a foot on the ladder, Copping says demand in Didcot has actually risen among first-time buyers this year, partly due to a pandemic-related exodus from London. Buy-to-let landlords have also been less active in the town. Selling to young couples rather than landlords involves a lot more work, Copping says. But we get real satisfaction from it. Theyll forget us but we wont forget them. The couple made some modest improvements (it helps that Harkness is handy) and bought a cheap barbecue for the tiny garden. Sitting in their small living room in late July, five-week-old Amaya asleep on Martinezs lap, they are aware that they are ahead of the game. Their friends are still mainly paying ratcheting rents for rooms in shared houses, with no obvious way out. Others are leaving the south-east to move to cheaper areas in Scotland and south Wales, aware that in some cases they will unlikely be able to afford to return. Its really hard, says Martinez. The couple are now trying to make friends in Didcot, where they are a 20-minute walk from the high street and train station. But they feel lucky, and are naturally positive. You have to go for what you can get and make lemonade out of lemons, Harkness says. PS25m - Belgravia, London If I were to say that refrigerated bathroom cabinets were becoming standard now, you might think Im a little crazy You wont find anything so vulgar as a for sale sign outside a grand house on a coveted square in Belgravia. But the owner of the property, a Scandinavian businesswoman who declined to talk but kindly let me look around, certainly wants to sell it. Just dont even think about offering her anything less than PS25m. Im greeted at the triple-locked front door by Simon Deen, the estate agent tasked with finding a buyer for the Grade II-listed 19th-century house. Six floors rise from the basement in a layer cake of gleaming stucco. Deen offers me a Mini Magnum from an enormous freezer a few days after the marketing launch. It had been a hot evening, and the ice-creams had felt like a nice touch. At this level of the London super-prime market of PS10m-plus properties, houses become brands, with their own social media accounts and expensively produced digital content. Or theyre quietly sold off-market - the sellers preference in about half of such sales, Deen says. Yours for PS25m - or more ... Photograph: Ryan PrinceThe Guardian Either way, Londons super-prime market is buoyant. Relaxing travel restrictions and a weak pound have helped it return towards its 2015 peak, about the time the then mayor Boris Johnson boasted at a real estate conference in Mayfair: London is to the billionaire as the jungles of Sumatra are to the orangutan. We are their natural habitat. There were 155 sales above PS10m in the capital in the year to April 2022 - the highest number for six years, the estate agent Knight Frank reported in July. Forty-six of these transactions were above PS20m. And after a slight cooling prompted by tougher planning, higher taxes, Brexit and the pandemic, foreign buyers are back in force, accounting for 80% of the latest sales (if not the Russians, although Deen says they have not been very active for years). The leafy squares and avenues of Belgravia, which border Kensington and Chelsea, are at the heart of super-prime London. This particular house has always been home to the very rich, including naval commanders and sons of baronets. Related: Super-prime mover: Britains most successful estate agent To the casual viewer not in possession of a spare PS25m (the asking price is actually PS27m at the time of writing), the 10-bedroom house looks to be in excellent condition. The marble floors and stone fireplaces are buffed, the chandeliers sparkle and the basement swimming pool shimmers under a giant mural featuring a Greek temple and cedar trees. But no major work has been completed here since the late 1990s, and Deen knows that any prospective buyer will want to bring it up to the standards of the 21st-century super-rich. He persuaded his client to wait for almost a year so that he could commission designs and get planning permission for a total refurbishment. The owner is abroad when I visit, and personal effects have largely been stripped away, bar a few family photos and a bedside copy of Melinda Gatess memoir, which Malala Yousafzai described as an urgent manifesto for an equal society. In each room, computer-generated images of the new scheme stand on easels. Therell be a new wine cellar and a hammam, and the existing gym and cinema will switch places. There will be air-conditioning throughout and eight suites as finely finished as those of a five-star hotel. Deen estimates the work would cost at least PS6m to complete. Graham Harris, the man behind the designs, is a founding partner at SHH Architecture and Interior Design, the go-to firm for the super-rich doer-upper. His other work has included a vast mansion on Belgrave Square that at one point had an asking price of PS125m (its basement swimming pool turns into a ballroom at the flick of a switch). He also masterminded the restoration of Athlone House, a neo-gothic pile on the edge of Hampstead Heath that, even in its former derelict state, cost the Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman PS65m to buy in 2016. (Harris had finished the job long before Fridman was sanctioned after Russias invasion of Ukraine.) A computer-generated image of the proposed informal dining areaorangery. Photograph: Simon Deen Real Estate Harris, who is 59 and set up his firm in 1992, says his job is to stay ahead of the mores of his uber-prime clients. So if I were to say to you that refrigerated bathroom cabinets were becoming standard now, you might look at me and think Im a little crazy, he says. But if youve got your Creme de la Mer tubs of moisturising cream at PS150 a pop [for 30ml, or PS1,780 for the 500ml tub], where are you going to keep them? Harris has also recently completed several gin rooms, a 26-car basement garage and what he claims to be the largest private walk-in humidor in Europe. This house is small by his standards at 9,000 sq ft, which is more than 10 times the UK average, but less than a quarter of the size of his biggest projects. I always say to my clients that you can live very comfortably with 6,000 sq ft, Harris says. Beyond that, youre going to kind of lose yourself. Deen, who is 41 and remembers drawing floor plans of his own modest home while growing up in north London, is aware that he operates in a world with a tricky reputation. Until money laundering laws tightened in 2017, buyers could hide behind offshore companies registered in tax havens. Pockets of super-prime London became stuccoed vaults for wealth of not always impeccable origin, the homes themselves often being left empty. But today, Deen says: I know who buyers are, where they live and that the funds are legitimate ... Apart from anything else, my clients want to know who theyre selling to because no one wants an issue down the line. Harris, who grew up in Leeds, where his father was a developer of leisure centres, says he thinks long and hard before taking on a client. We still have a moral compass, he says. He is hoping that whoever buys the house will proceed with his designs. Deen says interest has been high. He has a lot riding on the sale; while he is tight-lipped about his cut, a typical 2% commission would leave him with PS500,000 or more. As we leave, and lock the door behind us before the next viewing, the estate agent rushes to wipe up a drip of ice-cream that has fallen on to an immaculate slab of marble flooring. * Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The health secretary, Steve Barclay, wants the overseas recruitment spree to include sending NHS managers to countries such as India and the Philippines to hire thousands of nurses, the Times reported. The paper added that Barclay was also looking to make it easier for regulators to check international qualifications so that staff could begin working more quickly. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: Our new international recruitment taskforce is considering innovative ways to boost staffing numbers within health and adult social care. As part of this, we will work with the sector and recruitment experts to examine how to recruit staff from overseas more effectively into adult social care. Two weeks ago concerns were expressed over NHS staffing in England after analysis of workforce figures found that the health service may be becoming over-reliant on recruits from abroad. Figures from NHS Digital showed that the share of healthcare staff recruited from overseas almost doubled between 2014 and 2021, according to BBC analysis. Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, at the time called for urgent action from the government to tackle chronic staff shortages in the longer term. He said: International recruits have always been an important component of the NHS workforce. We recognise and highly value the contribution our overseas staff make to our teams and the care we provide to our patients. International recruitment should be seen as one part of a multistrand approach to workforce planning, and the governments code of practice for international recruitment helps employers ensure they are adhering to ethical recruitment practices. While there is also a focus on growing and retaining the domestic workforce, we cant escape the fact that there are 105,000 vacancies in the NHS and 165,000 vacancies in social care. We are in need of urgent action and the new prime minister must commit to publishing a fully costed and funded workforce plan to tackle chronic staff shortages in the longer term. That call was echoed by Dr Kitty Mohan, the chair of the international committee at the British Medical Society, who said the NHS did not have enough staff. The simple fact is that we do not have enough doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff to meet the growing and increasingly complex healthcare needs of our population, Mohan said. We are calling for the government and NHS England to publish a long-term workforce strategy as soon as possible.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"travel\/2021\/may\/16\/business-or-pleasure-top-10-best-work-stay-hotels-in-britain","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/travel\/2021\/may\/16\/business-or-pleasure-top-10-best-work-stay-hotels-in-britain","DATE":"2021-05-16 07:00:49","PLAIN_TEXT":"Birch, Hertfordshire A perfect place to blend both work and play, Birch is a country house hotel with a dedicated co-working space in the Hub.

When I replied that I was a journalist, one woman said: What do you journal?, while the other asked: What do you journalise on? I know that English is a fast moving and evolving language, but even so. I admit that Im a sucker for TV property makeover programmes: Love It or List It; Location, Location, Location; Grand Designs (though I do draw the line at Laurence Llewelyn-Bowens not-so-seductive Changing Rooms). My current favourite is Old House, New Home, presented by the ever-enthusiastic George Clarke. One small gripe, though; hes addicted to a couple of terms - pre-loved and upcycled, which are trotted out several times an episode. Come on, George, whats wrong with secondhand and recycled? Theyve served us perfectly well in the past. No need to gussy them up. A heartfelt plea from reader Jon Cartledge: May I have a word about the current obsession with working tirelessly? It seems that every statement of intent is currently accompanied by people working tirelessly towards a solution. What is wrong with delivering a good days work and feeling tired at the end of it? As an NHS consultant, I have too many examples of long, exhausting hours worked as a junior doctor. This was not tireless working, just work. Which puts me in mind of that perennial piece of politician speak - that theyre doing their very best for the hard-working people of this country.

For Charlie Mullins, the boss of Pimlico Plumbers, the answer is obvious: letting people work from home. Its a surprising line from a plumber. Surely homeworking has been a bonanza, with central heating being run all day, domestic loos in constant service, and dishwashers flogged like oxen? Not to mention people kicking bits of pipe in frustration when they read news stories. Even better, when the plumber comes, someone will always be in. Turn up any time between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday. In fact, Covid could have been engineered by plumbers. Can it be a coincidence that Mullins recently sold the company for somewhere north of PS120m? His remarks were echoed on ITVs Good Morning Britain a couple of days later by businesswoman Tina Knight, who said that the rise in working from home was setting a bad example to children. Speaking personally, Tinas comments were a wake-up call. I realised that until then, I had probably been one of these problematic home-workers. I would typically wake around 11pm and begin the day with a game of Russian roulette, making sure not to brush my teeth or floss. After that it would be time for the first drink of the day, usually a can of Carling, while I sent my daughter down the road for some fags. At 18 months she is old enough to buy them but still needs someone else to light them for her. As a reward I would let her drink a litre of Pepsi and settle in with an ultraviolent Korean revenge horror. Since reading Knights comments, however, I have decided to be more mindful about the example Im setting. I sit down at my desk at 8am and work until 5pm. Sometimes I go for a short walk. Nobody is more self-deceitful than the office worker, all of whom are complicit in a grand conspiracy - some call it being men - to convince those working at home - women, for most of history - that being in an office is more difficult and important than anything that takes place at home. It was always nonsense. The pandemic has simply lifted the veil. If the average child were to accompany their office-bound parent, by teatime they would be requesting a transfer to a different family. They would see sad figures trudging to transport hubs, perhaps via the first of the eight coffees a day they need to feel alive. They would spend the commute browsing trousers, looking at pictures of their enemies, or playing phone games about exploding sweets. The truly ambitious might listen to podcasts about billionaires gym habits or how celebrities overcame their fear of spiders. Others simply stare out of the window of the tube, peering into the void for a glimpse of their reflection. Once these grey automata make it to their building, they spend half an hour taking their coat off, going to the loo or getting another hot drink. By the time they have sat down and sent a few emails, it is time for the first pointless meeting of the day. Then its lunch. The afternoon typically passes in a mix of pointless meetings, pointless emails and other hollow diversions. Related: The first week back in the office - and WFH begins to seem easy This isnt to say that these activities arent open to the home-worker - they are. But at least at home, time wasting is obviously just that. In an office, surrounded by clacking keyboards and the hum of industrious photocopiers, time wasting can feel a lot like work. Americans are quitting their jobs in record numbers. Its not difficult to see why. Going to an office can be enough to make you feel like part of the world economy. Without the office environment to create the illusion of productivity, more of us are stopping to have a think about our options. Maybe there is more important work out there. Maybe, by working at home, we can save some time to hang out with the kids, or at least read on the internet about how to set a good example. Until then, my child will see a man in a chair at a keyboard, looking out at the rain and vaguely wondering how he is going to pay for everything. The office fetishists might not like it, but there could be no better preparation for life in the remainder of 21st-century Britain.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"environment\/2022\/dec\/13\/nature-positive-two-words-hoping-drive-deal-for-nature-cop15-aoe","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2022\/dec\/13\/nature-positive-two-words-hoping-drive-deal-for-nature-cop15-aoe","DATE":"2022-12-13 12:00:23","PLAIN_TEXT":"On the wall of the nature positive by 2030 pavilion at Cop15 in Montreal, children have written notes asking leaders to save turtles, frogs, swallows and wetlands. The message is clear. People dont want more of the same: stop the same and same is lame. They are simple, optimistic words that are also popping up in adverts, company pledges and the draft of the globalbiodiversity framework (GBF), which is the text outlining the next decade of UN targets to protect the natural world. Yet some are concerned the term nature positive is so hard to define that it opens up another frontier for greenwashing. For the climate, the aim of net zero has slipped into everyday conversation. For nature, no such term exists that has broken through to the general public. Many are keen to use nature positive as a way to get support for tackling biodiversity loss, and many scientists agree that it is an important term that should be included in the final agreement, to drive ambition. Leading conservation organisations such as WWF say the term communicates the need to tackle overconsumption, make production more sustainable and protect Earths key ecosystems. For us, [nature positive] is about setting an overall apex goal for nature that we have been missing for so long. By not having a clear overall goal, we have been allowing companies and governments to do whatever they want, says Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International. Childrens messages to world leaders take flight at Cop15 in Montreal Photograph: Phoebe WestonThe Guardian Initially, we thought: how can we come up with a goal that is equivalent to net zero emissions? That was our obsession. With nature loss, it is about consumption and production. Were really living beyond planetary boundaries as far as biodiversity is concerned. If we dont agree on this, we will offer cover to people who continue to greenwash, he says. More than 10 key organisations using the nature positive phrase define it in different ways, with little guidance on how it should be implemented, research has found, although reversing biodiversity loss and moving towards nature recovery and regeneration is included in most definitions. At Cop15, the general idea is to bend the curve on biodiversity loss so there will be more nature in 2030 than there was in 2020, and then reach full ecosystem recovery by 2050. Oxford biology professor EJ Milner-Gulland argued earlier this year that nature positive is crucial for communicating measurable improvements in biodiversity, but warned that it was already being watered down by corporations. It is already starting to feel like any actions that increase biodiversity anywhere, and by any amount, can be called nature positive. This trend has to be resisted, she argued. Mark Johnston from BP is at Cop15 as a delegate for Ipieca, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental issues. He is part of an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) working group on nature positive. Researchers warn that a company actively seeking new sources of oil and gas - as BP is - cannot seriously say it is on a journey to nature positive, and raise questions as to whether such a figure should be allowed to work on the technical aspects of nature positive from within the IUCN framework. In a nature-positive future, were not going to have fossil fuel companies Ej Milner-Gulland, biology professor The UN has not yet provided a list of delegates at the conference, so it is not known how many oil and gas representatives are present. There were more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists at the Cop27 climate conference in November, 25% more than last year. In a nature-positive future, were not going to have fossil fuel companies, says Milner-Gulland. Sophus zu Ermgassen, an ecological economist from the University of Oxford, agrees that in a nature-positive future, extractive industries will be tiny, just enough to meet societys residual fuel needs. He says: Its a strange definition of nature positive that would be consistent with the current business models of the oil and gas industry, and not one in line with the scientific evidence on what is required to halt climate change or nature loss. Stewart Maginnis, IUCN deputy director general, says the IUCN urges companies to rapidly transition to net zero and nature positive. We do not believe progress will be achieved by excluding experts associated with companies who are not yet on a nature-positive trajectory from technical discussions, he adds. Our mandate is to work towards high-integrity consensus-based agreement by bringing in expertise and different perspectives from NGOs, governments, academia and the private sector. A visitor views a wall covered with written pleas for a biodiverse future at the nature positive pavilion. Photograph: Phoebe WestonThe Guardian BP did not respond to the Guardians request for comment. Marilia Monteiro Silva of Greenpeace is among those who worry that nature positive risks being a way of saving an economic model that, by design, destroys the natural world because it can mean whatever people need it to mean. Governments should take nature positive completely off the discussion table. It is too risky to include ill-defined terminology with no metrics into the final agreement text, especially if youre inviting money into the picture, she wrote in a blogpost for Greenpeace International last week. She believes nature positive would be a bag of tricks for all the industry players who have been leading destruction of the planet, allowing them to continue. Milner-Gulland believes, however, that it is key to bring business along. Its easy to treat companies as the enemy, but thats not necessarily helpful because we need them on board. There is no solution without business - painting business as the enemy is an own goal. Related: Cop15: what are the key targets for the biodiversity agreement? Currently, companies have no real idea what their impacts are on nature. The World Benchmarking Alliances first Nature Benchmark, which looked at the operations of 400 global companies, found only 5% understand their impact on nature. In contrast, 50% of companies assessed are taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Milner-Gulland says industries and governments should commit to making a route towards nature positive but must be brutally honest about the scale of change that is needed, which goes far beyond planting wildflower meadows and providing vegetarian meals as default. It will require making systemic change, which is likely to include investing in nature restoration elsewhere to offset biodiversity impacts. Her research finds that applying nature positive will require huge improvements in data, transparency and better regulation, including a measured biodiversity baseline, timeframe, target, analysis of how those actions lead to net gain, and regular monitoring and disclosure of progress. Wordplay does not diminish a serious message in Montreal last week. Photograph: Phoebe WestonThe Guardian The scale of the challenge is large. A report by the UN Environment Programme (Unep) recommended that funding for nature should increase to $384bn per year by 2025 - more than double the current spend of $154bn - for climate and biodiversity goals to remain achievable. The report says private spending will have to step up to help fill the gap. A campaign by the Business For Nature coalition, signed by 330 businesses, is calling for world leaders at Cop15 to make it mandatory for all large businesses to assess and disclose their impacts and dependencies on nature by 2030. They will be able to do this next year via the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a parallel organisation to the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. About 750 companies and financial institutions are collaborating with the framework. The Science Based Targets network is looking into nature as well as climate. Universities are pledging to work towards nature positive, too. The University of Oxford carried out an audit of its biodiversity footprint and committed to reaching net gain for biodiversity by 2035. The Guardian has been working with the same researchers to start collecting data on its biodiversity footprint.

We recently sold a separate property that I used for work and cannot decide what to do with the proceeds of the sale. Our home would certainly benefit from some improvements (we live in a wet and windy rural location). However, with the increase in costs of construction and supplies, we are concerned that this is not the time to undertake such work. In light of the expected increase in interest rates and continued rise in the cost of living, what do you think is the best choice? The savings from clearing the mortgage are minimal and it would take us many years to build up such a nest egg again. My wife and I are going back and forth with this almost daily.DT A If your house is in need of essential repairs to make it weatherproof, now most definitely is the right time to get on with the work, whatever the price. The main reason for this is that under your buildings insurance you have a responsibility to keep your property in a good state of repair. If you dont and something happens to your house - the roof is blown off in a storm because you have not kept it in good condition, for example - your insurance wont cover you for the costs of repairing it. Keeping your property up to scratch also makes it a more comfortable place to live and can reduce what you have to spend on heating. However, if the home improvements are more desirable than essential, I would be tempted to get a quote for the work before making a decision. It may well be that the proceeds from selling your work premises can go towards both home improvements and reducing your mortgage. On a more serious note, you may need to put some of the proceeds towards paying any capital gains tax due, which needs to happen within 60 days of selling the property. Youll need to set up a capital gains tax account on the HM Revenue and Customs website. * Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

This sounds like a pandemic thing. It is - part of a new tide of office jargon coined for a workforce that hasnt visited an office in almost two years. I love working from home. Ive only got dressed from the waist up for almost two years. Nevertheless, remote working has consequences. Zooming recreates all the stress of the office without the mitigating compensation of actual human contact. Its dispiriting and exhausting.

The company, which made a loss of $556m in the same quarter last year, was also hit by an almost $500m non-cash charge relating to a settlement with ousted co-founder Adam Neumann. WeWorks quarterly revenues almost halved, from $1.1bn to $598m, as customer numbers plunged by almost 30% year-on-year from 693,000 last March to 490,000 a year later. The firm also incurred a charge of $299m driven by building exits, as it scaled back its portfolio. It has pulled out of 110 leases and renegotiated more than 280 leases since the start of last year, which will save $275m in rent. However, the company said it was starting to see the green shoots of recovery as the easing of pandemic restrictions and gradual return of workers to office locations improved its prospects. WeWork reported that occupancy rose from 47% in the final three months of last year to 50% in the first quarter. Occupancy rates had been at 72% before the pandemic. It said that desk sales improved across the quarter from 24,000 in January, to 25,000 in February and 38,000 in March - marking the first month since February 2020 when the company achieved both positive net desk sales and net membership gains. WeWork continues to see encouraging signs of a recovery with sales activity, a critical indicator of future revenue, ramping up over the first quarter, the company said. In March, WeWork announced it intended to merge with BowX Acquisition, a publicly listed special-purpose acquisition vehicle, two years after its own plans for an initial public offering (IPO) ended in spectacular disarray. The deal values WeWork at $9bn, a fraction of the frothy $47bn valuation the company achieved at a private round of financing from SoftBank Group in 2019. WeWork, which is raising $1.3bn from the flotation to capitalise on the the partial return to office life, has projected that occupancy at its restructured, more profitable portfolio of sites will hit 90% by 2022.

The company revolutionised the office rentals market, styling them with communal areas offering beer taps and football tables. But its rapid expansion came with huge losses, $2.9bn in the three years before its aborted IPO, and $3.2bn last year as the pandemic shuttered offices, forcing WeWork to embark on a major cost-cutting drive. Almost half of last years loss, $1.4bn, was a one-off charge related to the sale of a majority stake in its China business at a huge discount to previous valuations, and the disposal or wind-down of other assets.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2022\/apr\/16\/russians-who-fled-at-outbreak-of-ukraine-war-reluctantly-go-home","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/apr\/16\/russians-who-fled-at-outbreak-of-ukraine-war-reluctantly-go-home","DATE":"2022-04-16 16:16:16","PLAIN_TEXT":"When the war began, Olga Gladysheva, a former journalist who now works in video production, joined tens of thousands of other Russians fleeing the country. I left for Istanbul in a state of panic shortly after the war started. I thought I wouldnt get another chance to leave, that the borders might close. I didnt want to stay alone in the country as I saw all my friends leaving. I thought Russia was turning into North Korea, she said. But in Turkey her bank cards were blocked and she could not transfer money home to support her mother in Moscow. She survived by asking favours from friends who had access to funds. Now, reluctantly, she has returned home. I came back last week. Bluntly speaking, money is the main reason I had to return. I have a flat in Moscow that I was still paying for. I had the option to work from a distance but it wasnt the easiest option and I would earn more here in Moscow. Life wasnt sustainable for me in Turkey. As Russias war nears its third month with no end in sight, the hurried decisions that many Russians made to flee have hit the hard realities of emigration abroad, particularly at a time of closed borders and banking sanctions. While many Russians have left for ever, others have been drawn back to care for ailing parents, manage businesses, keep their families together or simply to make ends meet. It was a real family drama, said Roman, a tech startup co-founder who returned from Armenia last week. I thought we needed to get as far from Russia as possible. My wife didnt want to go anywhere and I had to search for some compromise. It was a matter of choice: leave Russia without my wife or come back with my wife. So I decided to come here with my wife and to see what happens. Experts say the wave of Russian migration provoked by the war is unusual, sparked by rumours of a forced mobilisation in early March and led by highly educated workers often travelling to smaller countries. And at least on paper, many have the option to return for either short trips or permanently. The atmosphere is really heavy here. All our mass media says that a lot of people support the war but thats not true Artem Taganov, tech entrepreneur Artem Taganov, the founder of the tech startup HintEd, left for Armenia in early March as part of the exodus of Russias tech sector. His partner and investors had urged him to leave the country immediately because of fears of a forced mobilisation, he said, and he had made plans to open a new company in Armenia. But after five weeks in the capital, Yerevan, he had returned to Moscow temporarily because of family and business concerns. The idea [in Armenia] was to open a company but its paused because Im waiting for some money. My wife and my dog are still in Moscow, my wife cant leave her work right now, he said. She had been working at an institute partnered with a British arts university that may terminate its agreements in Russia this year. Im trying to convince her to move. And still I have some business here, so we still need to support my company here. It was an uneasy homecoming. His parents, who live in another city and support the war, have told him he was wrong to leave Russia. He says he finds it difficult to call them and does not expect to see them until the conflict ends. When I was returning I was afraid that there would be a lot of cars with Z or V [symbols supporting the war] but Ive only seen one, he said. Still, the atmosphere is really heavy here. All our mass media says that a lot of people support the war but thats not true. In my close circle nobody supports it. Everybody here is afraid even to talk about this special operation. Nobody is smiling and everyone is sad. Pro-Russian troops in Mariupol. Fears of forced mobilisation forced many Russians to flee at the start of the war. Photograph: Alexander ErmochenkoReuters A senior executive at one of Russias largest IT companies said he had noticed the return of younger employees with lower salaries who had been priced out of cities such as Yerevan, Istanbul and Tbilisi. People left in a panic and then after some time they realised: OK, how are we going to continue living? the executive said. They still hate the situation, they still disagree and they still psychologically feel uncomfortable and they dont want to come back. But theres no way not to come back. There are no firm estimates of how many Russians left the country after the start of the war, which the Kremlin has termed a special operation. While tech workers may have strong prospects abroad, others may find their skills and education dont translate across borders. Dmitry, an art consultant, said he was in shock when the war started and fled the country due to rumours of a forced mobilisation. I flew to Uzbekistan, one of the easiest places I could visit without a visa. I returned to Moscow in late March when it became clear that the forced mobilisation was just a rumour. I realised that Europe was not an option for me. I am not sure Europe is waiting for Russians to come, even those that are against the war. What would I even do there? I barely speak any English. Ira Lobanovskaya, who runs an organisation helping Russians to settle abroad, said: Many left during the wave out of panic, just to have a breather. I see that some people are returning now. But I know that some of those who returned are making plans to leave again. They just needed to go back to Russia to get all their stuff, organise their papers and make concrete plans to properly leave. A number of factors could make it difficult for Russians travelling abroad, said Katrin Sommerfeld, a researcher at the Mannheim-based Centre for European Economic Research who focuses on refugee immigration. She has published a paper calling on German policymakers to bring forward a strategy on how to deal with migrants from Russia. Prices are rocketing in the countries where these individuals are going to, she said. Youre only allowed to take $10,000 abroad from Russia. You cant access your bank account. The rouble has devalued. So its harder to get your money and it is worth less. Things are very expensive. This makes it difficult and could perhaps feed into return migration, because if your money is burnt and it doesnt work abroad then what are you going to do? Some of those returning say they are often surprised by the indifference to the war. The main impression for me is that people are kind of accepting it, said the tech executive. The war is bad and Putin is evil but life continues. Its more or less alright here, the exchange rate is alright even if it is imaginary, some stuff disappeared from shops but its not as bad as we thought, the prices grew but its not that bad. It has really depressed me seriously to the bottom of my heart. In a recent poll, over half of Russians said they were not closely following the war. I thought I would witness horrible scenes on the streets, that people would be filled with pro-war anger, but life actually just goes on, said Olga Gladysheva. All the bars and restaurants are still packed every evening. It feels like people are ignoring the war - but that is scary too.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"business\/2021\/apr\/08\/working-from-home-is-a-failed-experiment","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2021\/apr\/08\/working-from-home-is-a-failed-experiment","DATE":"2021-04-08 08:00:09","PLAIN_TEXT":"I have a client who runs a business that was not considered to be essential and therefore had to shut his doors during the height of the pandemic and send his employees home to work. This went on for a few months. When, last summer, things started to relax, he called everyone back to the office. No exceptions. Working from home isnt an option in my business, he told me. I dont buy into it. I want my people here. Related: The robots are coming to small businesses - and for business owners | Gene Marks Is he out of touch? Perhaps. But this point of view is shared by more than a few clients of mine. Mostly, they fit a similar demographic: older, set in their ways, long time in business, family-owned companies. Its obvious that most companies will need to offer work from home options in the future. But whats more obvious, at least to me, is that so far, this has been a failed experiment. And, sooner or later, many small businesses are going to come around to thinking like my client. If you dont believe me, then just consider the results of a recent, large study from Microsoft. According to the study, almost two-thirds of the more than 31,000 full-time employed or self-employed workers across 31 markets said that they were craving (yes, craving) more in-person time with their teams and 37% of the global workforce complained that their companies were asking too much of them when out of the office. About 54% of these people feel overworked and 39% are simply exhausted. Thanks to these new working from home arrangements, meetings are significantly longer, chats have risen 45% and 41m more emails were sent in one month alone (February 2021) compared with the same month last year (remember when email was supposed to be dead?). While older workers and bosses seem to be handling things in stride (61% of them say they are thriving right now, a number that clocks in at a whopping 23 percentage points higher than those without decision-making authority), the younger generations - specifically the Gen-Zers (aged between 18 and 25) - are struggling to balance work with life and are simply more exhausted than their counterparts. They reported difficulties feeling engaged or excited about work, getting a word in during meetings and bringing new ideas to the table. Worse yet is the killing of innovation. Microsoft reports that companies have become more siloed than they were before the pandemic. And while interactions with our close networks have actually been more frequent than previously, the fact is that even these close team interactions have started to diminish over time. When you lose connections, you stop innovating, said Dr Nancy Baym, senior principal researcher at Microsoft. Its harder for new ideas to get in and groupthink becomes a serious possibility. All of this is taking its toll on workers and big companies are starting to take notice. Recently Citigroup announced a series of Zoom Free Fridays to encourage workers to get away from their screens and LinkedIn said it was giving its employees a paid week off to deal with the stresses that they have been enduring while working from home. Its also why the Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, told a conference recently that working from home is an aberration that were going to correct as soon as possible. So now do you see where my client is coming from? He wants his people back in the office where he can see them, talk to them, brainstorm with them, connect with them. Hes old school. And hes probably not wrong on this. Unfortunately, the work from home trend is too strong to resist. Thats because theres this illusion of more independence, flexibility and control over ones life which is probably why 70% of the workers who participated in the Microsoft survey, despite all their concerns, still desire some type of flexible work options in the future. There are also powerful interests at work to keep us at home. Big tech firms like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Apple love these arrangements because it ties their customers even further to their cloud-based collaboration subscription models. The giant media providers see more people at home clicking on their content. Big retail firms are enjoying the surge in online sales driven by bored, unsupervised workers. And corporate employers are sniffing big savings in real estate costs as well as the ability to hire better (and cheaper) talent regardless of geographic limitations. And yet, study after study shows that people working from home are more stressed and less happy. The model has proven to create more disruption, less productivity and diminished innovation. Small businesses, however, are going to have to figure out how to balance the perceived benefit (and demand) of remote work options with their costs.

In a sign of potential battles ahead over the surveillance of remote staff after the pandemic, Teleperformance - which employs about 380,000 people in 34 countries and counts dozens of major UK companies and government departments among its clients - has told some staff that specialist webcams will be fitted to check for home-working infractions. While these will in part be used for team meetings and training, the cameras are also connected to an artificial intelligence system that will randomly scan for breaches of work rules during a shift. If one is detected, a still photo will be sent to a manager and stored for up to 20 days, according to documents sent to staff. If workers need to leave their desks, for example to have a drink, they will have to click break mode in an app to explain why - for example, getting water - to avoid being reported for a breach. Related: Microsoft productivity score feature criticised as workplace surveillance Eating while on shift is not permitted, staff are told. If the system detects no keyboard stroke and mouse click, it will show you as idle for that particular duration, and it will be reported to your supervisor. So please avoid hampering your productivity. A training video about the webcam system, seen by the Guardian, says it monitors and tracks real-time employee behaviour and detects any violations to pre-set business rules, and sends real-time alerts to managers to take corrective actions immediately. The move triggered warnings from unions and MPs about the normalisation of home surveillance by employers as growing numbers of workers move away from being office-based. The revelations came to light after some of Teleperformances 10,000 UK employees were told that cameras, including the AI-based scanning system, would be installed next month for staff continuing to work from home. When approached by the Guardian, the company said the remote scans would not be used in the UK. Webcams for UK staff could not be operated remotely and would only be used for meetings and training, and for scheduled video calls when supervisors would check desks for devices not allowed for data security reasons, such as phones, a spokesperson said. Levels of remote scrutiny would be different in other countries, it said. While not a household name, the France-based company is one of the worlds biggest suppliers of outsourced phone services, including customer assistance, telemarketing and technical support. In Britain its clients include the health and education departments of the UK government, NHS Digital, the Student Loans Company, the RAF and the Royal Navy. The companies it works for include Vodafone, eBay, Aviva, Volkswagen and the Guardian. There is no suggestion any of these were aware of or involved in planning the new surveillance system. Related: Missing from desk: AI webcam raises remote surveillance concerns Teleperformance is understood to be rolling out the full webcam surveillance system in other countries where it operates. The company declined to say whether any of its UK clients use staff based elsewhere who might be subject to the monitoring. According to documents and video, at random times during a shift, the webcam system will scan the workspace for breaches, which include missing from desk, detecting an idle user, unauthorised mobile phone usage and another person being in the workspace area. The cameras will also be set up with facial recognition so they can detect if someone else is sitting at the desk. Employees are told: Any breach detected by the AI triggers a real-time alert to the supervisor for further actions. The company literature acknowledges that family or other household members cannot be kept completely away from workspaces, and said managers would not take action if their presence was detected as long as the people in the background are not directly looking into the screen, or very close to it. To avoid this, staff are asked to have their screens facing a wall. Staff working at night are instructed to ensure their desk has sufficiently strong lighting to ensure the camera can see what is happening. Howard Beckett, assistant general secretary of Unite, said the union would fight legally and industrially to prevent any push to normalise home surveillance. Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights minister, said that particularly when companies were relying on home-working staff to keep them going, it was wrong to impose invasive surveillance that will erode their rights to privacy and create a climate of fear and mistrust. After the Guardian asked Teleperformance about UK staff concerns, a senior manager contacted employees to explain that they would not be randomly monitored, adding that it was extremely disappointing the media had been alerted and that this was considered gross misconduct. It is not clear why UK staff were initially told to expect the comprehensive surveillance system. A spokesperson for Teleperformance said the company wanted to discuss any concerns with workers and that the webcam system was intended to respond to the overwhelming concerns of isolation, lack of team engagement and support, not seeing anyone from one day to the next, raised by those who are at home. She said: We absolutely trust them to do their jobs in a professional manner. We are taking very seriously the concerns you raised ... as they can be no further from the truth. No staff would be forced to work from home, the spokesperson said, and discussions would take place to reassure them. It was, however, of utmost importance that our employees work in a secure home office environment to meet our clients and their customers expectation of a high level of protection when it comes to processing their personal data, including sensitive personal data, she said.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"lifeandstyle\/2022\/nov\/28\/a-new-start-after-60-i-quit-drinking-and-learned-to-make-guitars","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2022\/nov\/28\/a-new-start-after-60-i-quit-drinking-and-learned-to-make-guitars","DATE":"2022-11-28 07:00:17","PLAIN_TEXT":"When Paul Edwards left school at 15, he headed to the careers office in Salford, Greater Manchester, to speak to the man behind the glass hatch. The careers officer riffled through his little box of cards, and pulled out two. One card advertised a vacancy for a violin-makers apprentice; the other for a precision grinder, which paid twice as much. Edwards mother told him there was no choice. He became a precision grinder. He must have thought about this fork in the road many times since, because two years ago, at 62, he built a guitar. And the first thing I thought was: Why didnt I do this when I left school? Instead, he hopped from place to place, following work or girlfriends. I never really had a career path, he says. He had worked from the age of 12, painting ships alongside his father in the docks at Old Trafford. You grow up fast when youre the oldest of six boys. Edwards childhood home was full of music. My mum was singing all the time. I can still hear her now. One day my prince will come ...  The radio was always on. We had records. At 13, Edwards saved his wages and bought a PS50 bass on hire-purchase. It was red, shiny and beautiful. He had always been good with his hands, so when the precision grinding didnt work out, he got a job as a stagehand at the Davenport theatre in Stockport - his first step into the arts world. Further stints in the same vein followed - building sets at Cambridge Arts theatre, and working for a company that made structures for rich peoples parties. After he got married at 30, and had two children with his now ex-wife, music mostly faded from Edwards life. His childhood bass broke. He did a degree in civil engineering, became a maths teacher in Sussex, and when his marriage ended, turned to drink: Two or three bottles of wine with a meal. Then I started drinking spirits, he says. He returned to Salford in 2016 to care for his mum. Health problems - from breathing in sawdust for 20 years - made it impossible to work. His brother Graham gave him a guitar to fix. An old broken Fender, Edwards says. He wasnt interested in Fenders. He liked Gretsches. He said: You can have this if you want. It was in bits. I looked at it for a while, and didnt do anything with it. I had that Fender my brother had given me. So I decided Id do something about it - basically thinking of him When his mum died in 2018, Edwards drinking got worse. Then, two years later, Graham died suddenly in his sleep, and Edwards fell into a deeper despair. That was just a killer. He was supposed to be coming round the next night. It wasnt like he didnt have any plans. I went mad on the booze. In the two weeks between Grahams death and his funeral, I was waking up on the floor. Occasionally, Id have two bottles of rum a day. It was so stupid. He thought of ending his life. I thought: Should have been me, you know? Not him. Im the oldest. Hes 10 years younger than me. I used to change his nappy. Edwards was always a helpful child. My mum used to call me her little prince, he says, and saying the words makes him laugh. A week after Grahams funeral, Edwards had a realisation. I dont know why. Something made me stop. I just thought: This is stupid. I had that Fender hed given me. So I decided Id do something about it - basically thinking of him. He set about putting the pieces together. Since then Ive been hooked on it. He had other broken guitars lying around. He overhauled his shiny childhood bass, which is now a jigsaw of differently grained woods. Then he thought, Why dont I make one from scratch? Ive got skills. I had the tools. Now he has music and craft in his life, and he hasnt had a drink since 2020. Im learning things all the time. Creating new things that I think are beautiful, he says. The Telecaster that Graham had given him now features a sunburst of grained veneers. He plays along to Bob Dylan or JJ Cale, and occasionally Ill find the right key before the songs finished. Im not that good, he says. But Im not playing for anybody else. Im doing it for me. Im doing it to make me feel nice. And it does. Its better than any drugs.

In fact, survey upon survey show a vast majority of Australians now want remote working to be a regular feature of their lives. Many workers are enjoying the flexibility to structure their days as they see fit, from replacing morning commutes with yoga to catching a few rays of sunshine on mid-afternoon walks. And despite the Covid-19 imposed adjustment, workers have remained as productive as ever. The good news is the benefits arent going unnoticed. Business leaders are wasting little time making the necessary changes to accommodate remote working. Related: Avoiding single-use plastic was becoming normal. Heres how we can return to good habits Prior to Covid-19 around 10% of our staff had flexible work arrangements, long term I expect that will be more like 40%, says Allyson Carlile, head of people and culture at insurance firm Metlife Australia. The rigid corporate lifestyle that compelled workers to long office hours, often at the expense of family and personal wellbeing, is undergoing a pandemic-inspired revolution. Historically, there was a view that remote working wasnt appropriate for law firms and the sector was somewhat fixated on presenteeism and being seen. The pandemic has put paid to that, says Andrew Pike, Australian executive partner at Herbert Smith Freehills (HSF). The law firm found its employees largely enjoyed the work-from-home benefits, which improved their outputs. Many have found working from home makes it easier for them to complete tasks that require a great deal of attention or peace and quiet, Pike says. Working from home also means more time with loved ones. Confinement-induced relationship tensions aside, 66% of Australian respondents to a Salesforce survey say remote working has brought them closer to their families. The new arrangement certainly had its sceptics, particularly at the beginning of the crisis. The insistence on presenteeism is a long tradition stemming from management fears of worker complacency. But with company heads now seeing the tangible benefits of remote working on productivity and employee wellbeing, those attitudes are quickly shifting. Sending everyone home meant that leaders were forced to trust their people and our people showed that not only could they be trusted but, in a crisis, they would go above and beyond, Carlile says. A lot of people dont clock off But the sudden enthusiasm for remote working over recent months can evaporate just as quickly without guardrails. Working from home can be quite liberating, but it can also end up being a bit of a prison, says Sara Charlesworth, director of RMITs Centre for People, Organisation and Work. Working from home has the potential to affect the hours people work, and their decision to work at all. Already seen as an alternative to sick days before Covid-19, some research suggests many workers do not feel comfortable taking sick leave while working remotely. Charlesworth also highlights the risk of overworking, or intensification and extensification as she puts it. Workers are increasing their output to compensate for the lack of visibility offered by an office, and to reassure their colleagues and bosses theyre online and working. This is bleeding working hours into home life, Charlesworth warns. A lot of people dont clock off at 6pm, they continue working. Its a pattern observed at Metlife Australia, prompting company heads to nudge employees to disconnect from work. We encouraged people to set up proper workstations in a dedicated space where possible so they can leave work at the end of the working day, and set boundaries, such as switch off the computer, Carlile says, adding that employees eventually got used to the arrangement. The dangerous flipside Companies are looking to remote working not simply for the benefits to productivity and work culture but to help cut costs amid the economic turmoil caused by Covid-19. It was certainly the motivation that led to energy giant Worley cutting 1,900 jobs globally. The company is also exploring property rationalisation - the potential to reduce office space by having more employees work flexibly and remotely. The downturn also prompted Australian brands such as Westpac and Optus to announce similar shifts to remote working. As revenue-strapped companies sift through the tasks that can be done remotely, they are also designating those that can be done without a human hand altogether. The dangerous flipside was made most transparent by the recent Woolworths decision to cut 1,350 warehouse jobs. In explaining the job cuts, the retail heavyweight said it was building automated distribution centres that could do the work of humans, making warehouse employees effectively redundant. Remote working is one way to cut costs, automation is the other - and they come hand-in-hand as companies plan for survival. While some workers enjoy the luxury of remote life, others could be left without a job. More companies are exploring automation technologies, and more companies are rapidly digitising their businesses, says Andre Dua, senior partner at McKinsey. As seen at Metlife Australia and HSF, companies have discovered during lockdown that a bulk of their operations can be done remotely. The alarming addendum to this point, Dua says, is that companies are also realising that their work can be performed with anywhere from 5%-25% fewer employees. And the acceleration towards automation isnt just affecting warehouse workers. Office jobs will not be exempt from automation, Dua warns. In fact, McKinsey identified several office jobs - such as secretaries, administrative assistants, bookkeepers and office clerks - at high-risk from automation even prior to Covid-19. The pandemic is only accelerating these trends. Dropping the ball on training Inclusive training by way of wide-ranging, large-scale programs is needed, Dua says, to address the challenges of worker displacement that Covid-19 is accelerating. If companies are adopting a digital-first, remote-working approach to their operations, then training efforts ought to focus on workers most vulnerable to job cuts and automation. There is an opportunity to build a new kind of workplace, one that could be more inclusive if we are really committed to doing that, says Dr Niki Vincent, commissioner for equal opportunity in South Australia and convenor of the SA Chiefs for Gender Equity. Women are overrepresented in automation-risky jobs, such as secretaries and retail workers. Vincent suggests governments can play a role in encouraging more women to study Stem fields, which will open pathways to the very likely-remote jobs of the future. The fact is there are still not enough women choosing to study things like engineering or coding, she adds, noting that only 16% of Stem professionals in Australia are women. Related: Quarantine salad: What two weeks in an isolation hotel has taught me about eating well with less Companies also need to throw their weight when it comes to upskilling, and cease taking the easy road of downsizing. Upskilling is a fantastic idea, but it means youve actually got to invest in your workforce, Charlesworth says. Downsizes are likely to continue until companies acknowledge, or are incentivised, to upskill their employees instead of cutting them off the payroll. As a country, we have really dropped the ball in terms of on-the-job training, Charlesworth adds. Companies shooting themselves in the foot Attitudes on remote working have shifted so dramatically in the last four months that workers are now setting expectations for flexible conditions as a factor in choosing the right job. Companies who want to go back to a 9-to-5 mandatory working culture will be shooting themselves in the foot, Vincent says. Cultural acceptance of remote working will encourage more companies to embrace a flexible approach. If they dont, they could lose out on talent. Organisations that are more opportunistic about finding the right talent when they can, wherever they want to reside, will have a competitive advantage, Dua says. That message has been heard by business leaders, who also see a benefit in accessing a larger talent pool not confined to geography. [That] we can access talent in remote locations means we can really assess the best person for a role based on capability, with location not being a significant factor, Carlile says. One of Australias leading law firms appears to be following suit, with Pike declaring the office will now be the exception rather than the rule. It is an exciting thought - living in the Hunter Valley or sitting on a beachfront in Port Douglas while remotely plugging into a decent-paying corporate job headquartered in Sydney or Melbourne. If the pro-remote attitudes at Metlife Australia and HSF are indicative of corporate Australias thinking, that dream might actually become a reality. The challenge now is ensuring vulnerable workers arent left behind. This article was amended on 7 July to state that Worley is considering cost savings on office space through shifts to more flexible and remote forms of working, it had previously stated that this move had already taken place.

Almost all of them have been ejected from their homes because of the war in the region, which has worsened since Russias full-scale invasion began in February. The three houses, run as a charity nursing home, are in an area of Ukraine surrounded on three sides by more than 100,000 Russian troops. For now, life for the residents is relatively quiet. But a major battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces across the area is expected to begin at any moment. I saw what happened in Debaltseve. I saw the bodies on the road and the shot-up cars. said Ievhen Tkachov, the head of the nursing home, about a major battle between Ukrainian and Russian-backed forces that took place in early 2015. Elderly women in a nursing home in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk Region. Photograph: Ed RamThe Guardian I know there will be no water, no electricity, no heating, no medicine. This lot will become a mass grave in a matter of days, said Tkachov, referring to his vulnerable residents. We have to go. For more than a decade, Tkachov and his family, who are Pentecostalists, have been running charity projects for vulnerable people in the Donetsk region. They started by organising summer camps for children living in state-run homes, then moved on to working with people with drug and alcohol addictions. The nursing home they run is part of a Proliska, a network of non-partisan charitable projects funded in part by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in six different towns in the Ukrainian-controlled east of the country. Interactive When the war in the Donbas started in 2014, elderly people forced to leave their destroyed or cut-off homes were taken care of by a combination of locals, including businesses, and international humanitarian organisations. But as the war in Ukraine dropped out of the headlines and money in the region dried up these elderly people found themselves with nowhere to go, said Tkachov. The issue is that the Ukrainian state will only look after elderly people who have no relatives, said Tkachov. He said that most of the residents children did not want to look after them. The children must go through a court process to sever their ties for the state to take them. The children are either estranged or find it too difficult emotionally. Men lie in bed in a nursing home in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk region. Photograph: Ed RamThe Guardian In Chasiv Yar there are separate houses for men and women and a third house that acts as a hospice. Several of the residents have already been evacuated. In the mens house, the Guardian met an 84-year-old widower, Yevhen Kryvoshey, who was evacuated a month ago from Izyum. Izyum is a town near Kharkiv that has been at the centre of fierce fighting between both sides, and has been described by the citys authorities as a second Mariupol. Interactive They dont have a visitors book, so Ive written a review myself, said Kryvoshey, holding a piece of card while balancing on a stick with his other hand. Your work and labour will stay with me for eternity. I havent met so much goodwill in all my life, read Kryvoshey. Kryvoshey had been put on a truck by the Ukrainian army in mid-March and taken, together with 40 other residents from Izyum, to a church in north Donetsk region. He spent the night sleeping on a mattress on the church floor. Despite his age and fragility, he had no complaints. It was comfortable, clean and warm. Elderly women in the nursing home. Several residents have already been evacuated before. Photograph: Ed RamThe Guardian The only thing was the [army] truck jolted to a halt suddenly on our journey. I hurt my foot and lost my dentures. Theres nowhere open to get new ones, said Kryvoshey. He also lamented the possessions he had left behind: Did you know I had to leave my first edition books? I had one from 1872. Related: After Bucha, Im afraid of Russian soldiers: people in east Ukraine prepare for fresh assault Not all the residents are as upbeat as Kryvoshey. A few have signs of dementia and about 10 are bedridden. In the hospice house, one 80-year-old man originally from Svitlodarsk, a town on the 2014-22 eastern Ukraine frontline, was evacuated more than a year ago because of the fighting. He stopped eating from stress a month ago, said Tkachov. His body has withered away and is barely visible beneath the sheets. Another woman, 72-year-old Larysa Mochaleva, bursts into tears every time she hears the war mentioned. Her thigh bone was broken three weeks ago when she fell hiding from shelling in her apartment in another frontline town, Popasna. [Popasana] doesnt exist anymore, said Mochaleva. When Mochaleva was evacuated, her husband was left behind. He found out only by chance that she was in Chasiv Yar. He is now living in the mens house. Their son, who fled another town in Donetsk region, will pick them up when they are evacuated to western Ukraine. Regional mayors in the towns of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk told the Observer that more than 70% of residents have fled to avoid being caught up in the battle. Many of those who are left, said the mayors, are elderly people who have nowhere to go or are too immobile to travel.

Jamie Dimon, JP Morgans chief executive, said 10% of the US investment banks 255,000 employees may work from home full-time. Other staff will continue to work at home for some of the time, he added in a letter to shareholders published on Wednesday. Representatives for HSBCs UK call centre staff are in discussions with the bank concerning up to 1,200 workers making a permanent switch to remote working. Services companies across the world are considering whether to continue some of the ways of working forced on businesses by lockdown rules. In the UK, the government is planning to remove all social distancing rules after 21 June, a move that could allow workers to return to offices en masse. The construction of JP Morgans new HQ in New York will continue, and more employees will be consolidated there, said Dimon. However, overall the changes would significantly reduce our need for real estate, he wrote. The bank will use more digital tools for employees to book office seats and conference rooms. For every 100 employees, it could need seats for only 60 on average, Dimon said. Cost-cutting will be a key motivator for many businesses moving staff to permanent home-working, but flexible working patterns will also be offered more as perks to retain staff, said Victoria Short, chief executive of the recruitment company Randstad UK. Theres an increased expectation from your employees that you will offer some form of flexibility, she said. If you want to remain competitive in the war for talent, having this as an option will become increasingly important. Many employers - and particularly professional services companies - have already said they intend to embrace hybrid work patterns, giving staff access to offices when necessary but also allowing them to work from home. Grant Thornton, the UKs sixth largest accountancy firm, found that nine in 10 of its staff wanted to work most of the week from home, its chief executive, David Dunckley, told the Financial Times this week. The company reduced the size of its Manchester office last year. The accountancy firm PwC last week said its flexible working policy would allow its 22,000 staff to work from home about half the time.

The building, designed in the studios of Thomas Heatherwick and Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, has a capacity of up to 4,000 workers.

Having spent the last 18 months immersed in the idea of an independent Wales, I can attest that this is a real movement, with legitimate grievances which should be taken seriously. This isnt to say that independence is inevitable but just that, like the leave campaign or those for an independent Scotland, these issues are fringe, minority movements - until theyre not. Perhaps the biggest surprise when I started researching this area is how, especially for people who have come to the idea of Welsh independence since Brexit, identity is only a secondary motivating factor. For them it is, first and foremost, a matter of the head not the heart. Most supporters have simply looked at the state of the United Kingdom, seen that it isnt working for Wales, and view independence as the most effective vehicle for fixing Waless problems. That doesnt mean independence necessarily is the answer, just that the status quo is leaving the country both impoverished and unable to fix the problems it has. Take poverty. Wales has lower pay than the UK average, and just under one in four people in Wales live in poverty. Approximately 600,000 children live in Wales, and of them 200,000 - a third - are in poverty, with 90,000 in severe poverty. You could argue that this means Wales is too poor to be independent, but independence advocates may point out this situation has come about under the current system. Do these figures suggest Westminster has been a good custodian of Wales? One way to bring people out of poverty is to improve their infrastructure. But here we see why Waless plight is only likely to get worse. Look at HS2. The UK government has decided to class HS2 as an England and Wales project, despite not a centimetre of track actually being laid in Wales. This accountancy sleight of hand means that Wales, unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, will receive no Barnett formula cash from HS2. Successive Conservative chancellors have said that HS2 will benefit Wales, therefore no extra money is needed. When asked what the benefits will be, they point to the fact that people in north Wales will be able to get to London slightly faster. If Wales got its fair share, it would be getting PS5bn in funding. This could finance the south Wales and Swansea Bay metros, integrate the north Wales lines with Merseyside, and connect Aberystwyth and Swansea by rail (at the moment, perversely, you have to go across the border via Shrewsbury to get to Cardiff from the Welsh west coast). Puts getting to London a bit quicker in context, doesnt it? This decision to single out one of poorest parts of the UK as the only nation not to receive a substantial rail investment uplift underlines the emptiness of the levelling-up promise. And its the ultimate campaigning tool for those seeking an independent Wales. The independence movement in Wales is at a crossroads. Campaigners have gained a decent following from visible, attention-grabbing online campaigning. But the time has come for legitimate, realistic conversations. For instance, the far greater physical complexity of Wales leaving the union compared with Scotland must be thought through. Fifty percent of people in Wales live within 25 miles of England, and the north-east of Wales is one of the most commuted out-of areas in the UK. The realities and challenges independence would pose to peoples way of life have to be reconciled. Camerons decision to give Scotland a vote on independence set a precedent that the decision to stay in the UK lies with the people of the respective nations. In its last Welsh parliamentary election campaign, Plaid Cymru said that if it won a majority, it would hold an indicative vote in its first term, and a full referendum if it won a second. With his calls for home rule - essentially devo max - Mark Drakeford, the first minister, has in effect parked his tanks on Plaids lawn, leaving the party with only independence to aim for to differentiate itself from Welsh Labour. But the very fact that we are having this conversation is positive. There is a reason why the UK government doesnt dare pull the same trick with Scotland regarding HS2 as it does with Wales; having a Wales that is assertive will be a benefit, whether it is independent or not. Despite being the oldest nation on these islands, there is still a feeling that Cymru is trying to work out what it will be when it grows up. The debate over independence, whether won or lost, can create a Wales better placed to tackle the myriad problems it faces. Will Hayward is Welsh affairs editor at WalesOnline.

I read it by torchlight under the bedclothes, not because of parental curfew or power cut, but because that seemed the safest place to read what was, unmistakably, the eeriest novel Id ever met. Eeriness is different in kind to horror. Eeriness thrives in edge-of-the-eye glimpses; horror is full-frontal. The eerie lives in the same family of feelings as Freuds uncanny, which in its original German, unheimlich, means unhomely. A core power of Coopers novel lies in its counterpointing of the homely and the unhomely. It opens in the domestic clamour of the Stanton family house, in a quiet English village in the upper Thames valley. Its 20 December: the eve of both the winter solstice and the 11th birthday of Will, the youngest of the Stanton children. Inside the house, all is pre-Christmas chaos, baking smells and familiarity. But in the wintry landscape around, something is very wrong. Rooks are behaving strangely, dogs are suddenly afraid of Will, a blizzard is coming, and a shadowy awareness of evil is building. Wills life is about to change for ever - for he will become caught up in an ancient battle between the forces of the Light and those of the Dark, which are always strongest at midwinter. His young shoulders are soon to bear an immense burden. The Dark Is Rising sank deep into my bones. Its characters - tall Merriman, capable of such warmth and such wrath; the Lady with her leitmotif of haunting, ethereal music; wise young Will; horned Herne - leapt into my imagination, and have never left. I was also deeply influenced by Coopers sense of landscape as a memory-shaping, time-slipping medium, present more widely in the tradition of Anglo-American fantasy fiction that runs from John Masefields The Box of Delights, through Alan Garner, Ursula K Le Guins Earthsea books, Cooper herself and on to Robert Holdstock and Philip Pullman. Robert Macfarlane, whose sense of landscape as a memory-shifting, time-slipping medium was deeply influenced by Coopers book. Photograph: Bryan Appleyard Places, in the work of all these writers, carry auras and memories; they act both archivally and prophetically. Landscape is a palimpsest upon which ancient stories are both contested and renewed. Such ideas were powerfully formative for me as a writer, and Coopers presence is particularly strong in a book I wrote about walking, paths and history called The Old Ways (theres a significant Old Way Lane in The Dark Is Rising). I know of many other writers and artists, among them Katherine Rundell and Helen Macdonald, for whom Coopers work has also been influential. For Max Porter, the series did more for my imagination, for my vocabulary, for any curiosity or concern I had for Englishness, for history, for listening, than anything I learned at school; it gave him and his brother a mythology that we could see and feel around us in rural England, and on our windswept holiday weeks in Snowdonia. Millions of other readers have met Coopers work and never forgotten it. Five years ago, with the poet Julia Bird, I co-ran a midwinter Dark Is Rising reading group on Twitter. Thousands of people joined from dozens of countries. #TheDarkIsReading trended nationally on Twitter, and the online outpouring of affection for the book was immense. This winter, I hope The Dark Is Rising will find new audiences around the world. For, working with the actor, director and theatre-maker Simon McBurney, and supported by Complicite (the theatre company that Simon co-founded) Ive spent the past year adapting The Dark Is Rising as an audio drama. It will be broadcast first on BBC World Service in 12 episodes, beginning on 20 December, with an episode following each day, such that the broadcasts correspond to the real time of the novels own unfolding across the solstice, Christmas and New Years Eve. An early edition of The Dark Is Rising. Photograph: Publishers Handout I gave a copy of The Dark Is Rising to Simon back in 2017, when I realised hed never heard of it. Simon read it aloud to his son, Teyo. Then he read it aloud to Teyo for a second time. Then he and Complicite developed the idea of adapting it, and I jumped at their invitation of involvement. It made immediate sense to me to translate The Dark Is Rising into sound. For this is a novel, far more than most, to which one listens with the minds ear as well as seeing in the minds eye. Its soundscape is deeply complex; brimful of noises, melodies, songs and chants. Speaking aloud is crucial within it: words hold force when given voice - you must watch what you say. Its long been a puzzle to me that there arent more adaptations of Coopers novels (the book weve adapted is the second in a five-novel series, usually referred to as the Dark Is Rising sequence). There was an American film version in 2007, so appalling that I and all true Cooper fans refuse to speak its name. A radio adaptation for BBC Childrens Radio 4, 25 years ago. Other than that, nothing I knew of. Early in the process of adaptation, in discussion with Complicites brilliant producer Tim Bell, Simon and I resolved on four creative principles. First, that we would honour Coopers novel and its 50-year-long power of enchantment. Second, that wed make something far more ambitious than just an abridged reading of the book; third, that the supernatural elements of the production would be recorded binaurally, to immerse the listener acoustically; and fourth, that wed draw out the transnational nature of Coopers vision. For the Old Ones - the warriors of the Light - are drawn from every country and background, and it is a Jamaican Old One who gives to Will an object of immense power, without which his quest cannot be completed. It feels right to us that this adaptation will be broadcast on the World Service, and heard in nearly 90 countries. Working with Simon on the adaptation was inspirational; a 12-month masterclass in the skills of narrative pacing, dramatic tempo and creative perfectionism. As well as co-adapting the text with me, Simon also directed the performances and voiced the narrator. Complicite slowly gathered a superb cast including Toby Jones, Harriet Walter, Miles Yekinni as Herne, Natasha K Stone as the devil-girl Maggie Barnes, and 13-year-old Noah Alexander, who plays young Will Stanton. The Dark is Rising covers and illustrations. Photograph: The Folio Society, Simon &amp; Schuster, Puffin Though its structured around a Manichean opposition of Light and Dark, Coopers novel refuses to cleave into neat binaries. I think of it, in fact, as a cold war novel, first published in 1973 and kindred in its moral complexities to early Le Carre; describing a conflict fought in the shadows, in which no one is clean. At its heart is the relationship between the central Old One, Merriman (played by Paul Rhys in our adaptation), and his liege man Hawkin (played by Toby Jones). Merriman must have a splinter of ice in his heart to do what he does to Hawkin. This is a cold battle we are in, Merriman tells Will, chillingly, and we must sometimes do cold things. At the novels core is a hard question: when the dark comes rising, who will turn it back? Susan Cooper was born in Buckinghamshire in 1935. When I met her in the US, she told me how, when the air raid siren sounded during the blitz, her mother would hurry her and her brother down into a nearby bomb shelter. There, by candlelight, she would tell stories to the children to take their minds off the danger. What Cooper recalled - a detail that lifted the hairs on the back of my neck as she told me - was that when the bombs fell, their detonations would cause the candle flame to quiver. The nearer the explosion, the more the flame shook. Boom... shiver...Boom... shiver...Boom! Shiver! People have been telling stories to one another around fires of one kind and another for thousands of years. Cooper learned the power of storytelling in the air raid shelter as bombs fell around her. I first read her books by torchlight, and they helped me cope with the anxiety I felt then at the possibility of nuclear conflict. Now new-old fears - climate chaos, war, ecological collapse - menace our minds. The dark is always rising, and it is the work of the greatest stories to hold it back. The 12-part BBC audio adaption of The Dark Is Rising, commissioned by the World Service, will be broadcast on the World Service from 20 December, and on Radio 4 from 26 December ","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/2021\/may\/12\/work-from-home-guidance-end-england-21-june-johnson-indicates","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/may\/12\/work-from-home-guidance-end-england-21-june-johnson-indicates","DATE":"2021-05-12 17:22:23","PLAIN_TEXT":"Guidance that people in England should work from home if they can is to be dropped from 21 June, the prime minister has indicated. Boris Johnson told MPs on Wednesday the government intended to take the step when it moved to the final stage in its Covid reopening plans. That is certainly our intention, provided we stay on track, he told the Commons when asked about the proposal by the Tory MP Felicity Buchan. Well wait until were able to say that with more clarity a bit later on because we must be guided by whats happening with the pandemic. It does depend on keeping the virus down. The guidance encouraging people to work from home has helped drive down the risk of passing on coronavirus and government scientists have privately suggested it makes sense for people to continue working from home to reduce contact with others. default According to PA Media, a government scientist source said there was no reason to return to an office full-time if work could be done at home. The source said that, even last August, people were still only at about 50% of pre-pandemic contact levels with others. They added that measures this summer that could help keep case rates in check include home working, good ventilation in buildings, and tables being kept apart. But Buchan, whose constituency is in London, highlighted the difficulties facing the citys economy, with shops and cafes in town and city centres that relied on office workers hit hard by the change in working patterns. Downing Street would not be drawn on whether the governments chief scientific adviser (CSA), Sir Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer (CMO) for England, Prof Chris Whitty, backed the plan. The prime ministers spokesperson said: I cant speak for the CMO and CSA on this. The government always set out its intention to review this guidance ahead of step 4 [on the roadmap for England]. Asked what preparations were being made for civil servants to return to their desks, the spokesperson said: I think you are jumping ahead. We will set out our approach nearer the time to provide suitable preparation to all businesses and, indeed, the civil service. In February, the Guardian reported that there were concerns some employers were putting workers at risk and increasing Covid infection rates after research suggested as many as one in five people had been going into their workplace unnecessarily.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"money\/2022\/may\/17\/hot-spots-thermal-imaging-home-cash","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/may\/17\/hot-spots-thermal-imaging-home-cash","DATE":"2022-05-17 06:00:50","PLAIN_TEXT":"To really get to grips with where your home is needlessly costing you energy a thermal imaging camera is a great tool: it shows up exactly where the hotspots for heat loss are, in multicolour. In some parts of Britain it is possible to borrow one for free so you can find where to target your energy-saving efforts without any upfront cost. Transition towns - communities that are working to promote sustainability and cut emissions - often have a camera loan scheme for local people. Bear in mind that most of these projects are very small scale and rely on volunteers: if you want to borrow one on demand you will need to go for a commercial hire company. St Albans residents who have borrowed the cameras have reported being surprised by what they saw To use a thermal imaging camera effectively you need about a 10-degree difference between the temperatures indoors and outdoors, so the schemes typically operate only through the winter months. Sustainable St Albans is one group that runs a loan scheme - its been doing so since 2014 during which time several hundred locals have used it. Residents need to sign up for a training session before they can take a camera home, with the next one set to take place in the autumn. (People who are interested can sign up to a monthly email newsletter where they will see details at the time.) St Albans residents who have borrowed the cameras have reported being surprised by what they saw, with one saying there was a lot more heat loss than envisaged, and another saying even drawing the curtains made a difference. To use a thermal imaging camera effectively you need about a 10-degree difference between the temperature indoors and outdoors. Photograph: Cultura Creative RFAlamy Transition Bath also has a camera that people can borrow after training - Philip Haile from the group says this is because cameras can provide false positives, which users need to be careful to avoid. Typically the camera is a good conversation point in motivating people to think about their energy, he says. However, he adds that often it visualises issues the homeowners are already aware of - for example, missing loft insulation. In the Peak District, Transition Belper runs a scheme for the DE56 area with one camera and a volunteer who carries out a handful of surveys each winter. These are done for free but people can donate to the group if they wish. Some households have cut their bills by a third after having a survey done A project called CHEESE (Cold Homes Energy Efficiency Survey Experts), currently running in Bristol but soon to go nationwide, offers paid-for surveys to those who can afford them, and free surveys to those in fuel poverty. The cost of a survey on a two-bedroom house is PS135, says Nettie Burd from the organisation behind the project. They could get that back within one or two years, she says. Some households have cut their bills by a third after having a survey done. A survey of a 10-room house will take about three hours, and the person doing it will make suggestions for energy-saving measures as they go. One of the surveyors said recently that the reasons people get a survey done were three Cs: comfort, carbon or cost, Burd says. It might be that someone says: Its cold but we dont why - we need to find out what the problems are. Or they might be deciding to fit a heat pump, or they might be trying to cut their bills. For those who are struggling to even afford to put the heating on, the survey can alleviate some of the difficulty, she says, if they can get the work done. One in three of the surveys carried out by the organisation is done for free for a household in fuel poverty. They can show the results to their landlord or see if they qualify for grants.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"commentisfree\/2022\/oct\/14\/cost-of-living-crisis-students-loans-grants-inflation","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/oct\/14\/cost-of-living-crisis-students-loans-grants-inflation","DATE":"2022-10-14 15:31:08","PLAIN_TEXT":"The phrase cost of living crisis conjures an image of families struggling to feed their children and keep them warm this winter. However, there is another demographic currently absent from discussion of this emergency, despite half of them already being forced to cut back on food spending: university students. Most had an unprecedented end to their school years, studying remotely through a pandemic that defined not only A-levels and other final exams but their transition to university - the so-called best years of their lives. On top of all this, they now have to grapple with a financial crisis. The situation is harder still for working-class students, who are already grossly under-represented at top universities. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Sutton Trust found that the access rate for disadvantaged students was the lowest at the countrys most elite institutions. This statistic is one that I am painfully aware of - I often joked to my friends that I was the token working-class student at our university. However, while I was offered a bursary for low-income students, my younger sister was not. In her three years of studying, she has been forced to access her universitys hardship fund three times. The fund required her to submit bank statements to prove she genuinely needed the money - and justify her every transaction. Students have worked alongside their studies since long before this cost of living crisis. But, while having a part-time job can teach you valuable skills, it is important to maintain work-study balance - working too many hours can negatively impact ones studies, and lead to burnout. Many universities recommend working a maximum of 15 hours a week. Despite this, one study revealed that 9% of students work 21-30 hours a week and 11% work more than 31 hours. Clearly, this is unsustainable - but for some it is unavoidable. Working part-time jobs is the only way to keep afloat. One Birmingham student, who has worked throughout their degree and will graduate next summer, told me that, with no financial support from their parents, they have had to cut back on everyday non-essentials, social events and even replacing fallen-apart shoes to ensure they can keep a roof over their head. For my sister, who also graduated this year, a job wasnt a want, but a need - working alongside her studies was the only way she could afford her rent. As prices rise, even these hours may not be enough: as of June, 11% of students were already using food banks. And although working-class students will be more affected, those from the middle class are facing financial struggles too. Many rely on their parents for contributions towards living costs to get by, which also presents a crisis for students families. In a survey by an accommodation provider carried out in March, 73% of parents and 66% of students said that they were extremely worried about the cost of living at university. The same study found that 36% of parents are struggling to financially support themselves as well as their children at university, and have had to turn to other income streams: 10% of parents have taken out bank loans, and 3% have re-mortgaged their house in order to make ends meet and support their children. Related: Thousands of UK students face financial hardship as costs rise There comes the point where one has to question whether achieving a good degree grade is even realistic for those forced to work long hours to make ends meet. Its sure to put some students off applying for university entirely. For many working-class students, maximum student finance loans are the only way they can afford to go to university. Yet with loans not seeing an increase to match the rapidly rising cost of living, the dream of going to university will become unattainable for many, purely because of their financial background. I would like to think the government will not continue to sit back and watch this disaster happen. But the disastrous mini-budget doesnt bode well. Lets not forget that this is the same party that has signed off ruthless increases in tuition fees - or that the schools minister, Jonathan Gullis, recently declared his biggest fear to be private schools losing their charitable status. I would say mine is that other working-class students wont have the same access to higher education that I did. Students should not be expected to jeopardise their education to, paradoxically, fund their education, and neither should it be necessary for parents to sacrifice their own financial security to support them. Its time for student finance loans to be increased in line with inflation, or else the government must provide a tailored cost of living support package for students (as petitioned for by the NUS), similar to the one that 8 million families have already received. On a human level, the government cannot sit back and force students to choose between studying and eating. On a social level, the government must urgently put more money behind education. After all, these students will be one day running the country - investing in their education is investing in our future.

But as the Covid crisis continues, and more and more employers postpone or cancel plans for a return to the office, some managers are deploying increasing levels of surveillance in an attempt to recreate the oversight of the office at home. It has really ramped up, says Dr Claudia Pagliari, a researcher into digital health and society at the University of Edinburgh. People are home working, and many organisations are beginning to want to track what theyre doing. Such surveillance comes in many forms. Some of it is as simple as checking in, Pagliari says, stamping your timecard in a digital sense. You might have to do your work over the cloud, and it knows when youve logged on, for instance. Tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams report when an employee is active, and failure to open apps first thing in the morning is often taken by managers as the same as being late for work. Related: Working from home was the dream but is it turning into a nightmare? | John Naughton Other workers have reported more intense supervision. One communications worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said that her employer had recently started to require all staff to join a videoconference every morning, with their webcams switched on. Employees were told the move was to reduce the number of meetings, but many feel as though its true purpose is to ensure that they stay at their desks all day. David Heinemeier Hansson, a co-founder of the collaboration startup Basecamp, which provides a software platform for companies to coordinate their remote workers, says he regularly has to turn down requests from potential clients for new methods of spying on their employees. There is a depressing amount of demand and its mostly coming from dinosaur companies who have been forced through Covid to go remote, he says. They think that they have to replicate - or even increase - what they do in the office. We went so far as to say that our API [interface which allows other developers to build additions to Basecamp] cannot be used for any form of employee surveillance. Silkie Carlo, director of the anti-surveillance charity Big Brother Watch, says the trend is the natural progression of surveillance in the workplace. Now that is morphing into home surveillance it takes on a new shape and is more worrying, because some employers arent realising that yes, some employees are working from home, but the home still remains a private space, she said. Its important for peoples sense of autonomy and dignity, and their mental health, that the home remains a private space and we dont go down the route of this really invasive constant monitoring of peoples homes. Some employers say that the monitoring they have forced on employees is required for oversight or compliance reasons. But many employers are simply aiming for workforce optimisation, something Pagliari warns could have the opposite effect of that intended. Theres not really any evidence that workers are more productive when theyre monitored, she says. But what we do know is that the sense of being in a panopticon can actually depress you, and make you less productive. Earlier this year, the consultancy PwC came under fire for developing a facial recognition tool that logs when employees are away from their computer screens while working from home. According to PwC, it is designed to help financial institutions meet their compliance obligations, as workers would normally be monitored for security purposes on trading floors. For Carlo, the increase in monitoring is proof that employees need legal protection against a desire for ever more data. The consequences are going to be wild, she says. Its not consent if you cant choose.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"},{"ID":"world\/live\/2022\/sep\/15\/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-flooding-in-kryvyi-rih-after-missiles-hit-dam-at-zelenskiys-home-town","URL":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/live\/2022\/sep\/15\/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-flooding-in-kryvyi-rih-after-missiles-hit-dam-at-zelenskiys-home-town","DATE":"2022-09-15 20:10:36","PLAIN_TEXT":" 9.00pm BST Closing summary It is 11pm in Kyiv.

Someone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend (something) loves it. Explaining the difference between when it is moral or immoral to supply weapons to another country, Francis said: It can be immoral if the intention is provoking more war, or to sell arms or dump arms that (a country) no longer needs. The motivation is what in large part qualifies the morality of this action. The pope was also asked whether Ukraine should negotiate with Russia and if there was a red line Ukraine should draw, depending on Russian activities, after which it could refuse to negotiate. It is always difficult to understand dialogue with countries that have started a war ... it is difficult but it should not be discarded, he said, adding, I would not exclude dialogue with any power that is at war, even if it is with the aggressor. ...

We are helping ... because their fight is a fight that we are supporting, he said in a speech, listing ways that Berlin had aided Ukraine, from supplying armaments to training troops ... We have delivered more and more weapons. Weapons deliveries from us - but also from our allies - have contributed to things turning out differently to how the Russian president planned. Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has criticised Germanys refusal to provide tanks, saying that there was not a single rational argument on why these weapons cannot be supplied. Updated at 8.13pm BST 7.42pm BST Vladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday for his balanced approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washingtons ugly policies, at a meeting that followed a major setback for Moscow on the battlefield. The Associated Press reports: Speaking at the start of talks with Xi in Uzbekistan, Putin said he was ready to discuss unspecified concerns by China about Ukraine. We highly appreciate the well-balanced position of our Chinese friends in connection with the Ukrainian crisis, Putin said, facing Xi across a long table. We understand your questions and your concerns in this regard, and we certainly will offer a detailed explanation of our stand on this issue during todays meeting, even though we already talked about it earlier, he added. A Chinese government statement issued after the meeting didnt specifically mention Ukraine, but said Xi promised strong support to Russias core interests. While the statement gave no details, Beijing uses core interests to describe issues such as national sovereignty and the ruling Communist Partys claim to Taiwan, over which it is willing to go to war. Speaking after the meeting, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the assessments of the international situation by Moscow and Beijing fully coincide. We dont have any differences. He added that both countries will continue coordinating our actions, including at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. Lavrov described the talks as excellent, saying they were very businesslike and concrete, involving a discussion of tasks for various ministries and agencies.

Ukraine has been vying to join the EU since the start of the Russian invasion, and was granted candidate status in June. Von der Leyen said Ukraines ascension process is well on track. We support you wherever we can. Von der Leyen also offered a quiet rebuke of EU member state Germany for its delay in supplying Ukraine with military equipment, noting that its absolutely vital and necessary to support Ukraine with the military equipment they need to defend themselves. On her visit to Kyiv, Von der Leyen also announced that the European Union has earmarked EUR150m to aid internally displaced people in Ukraine get shelter through the winter, as well as EUR100m for reconstruction and repair work for schools that have been damaged in the invasion. Russian forces launched 33 rocket attacks on military and civilian targets in Ukraine today, damaging the infrastructure of more than 20 settlements in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Mykolayiv oblasts, the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces said in its daily briefing. The general staff said it believed that Russian forces were turning their focus to fully occupying the Donetsk oblast, holding captured territories and disrupting the activities of Ukrainian troops in other areas. The US has imposed new sanctions on 22 Russian individuals and two Russian entities. The individuals include Maria Alexeyevna Lvova-Belova, Russias presidential commissioner for childrens rights, who has led Russias efforts to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and forced the adoption of Ukrainian children into Russian families. The entities include Task Force Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that has participated in combat alongside Russias military in Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdogs 35-nation board of governors passed on Thursday a resolution demanding that Russia end its occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters is reporting. The resolution is the second on Russias invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agencys board of governors. A Ukrainian volunteer medic captured by Russian forces during their deadly siege of the port city of Mariupol delivered devastating testimony before US lawmakers on Thursday, recounting her experiences of torture, death and terror. Yuliia Paievska, who was detained in Mariupol in March and held by Russian and pro-Russia forces for three months, spoke before the Helsinki Commission, a government agency created in part to promote compliance with human rights internationally.

The resolution is the second on Russias invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agencys board of governors. Both resolutions were proposed by Canada and Poland on behalf of Ukraine, which is not on the board, the agencys policy-making body. The text calls on Russia to immediately cease all actions against, and at, the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine and was passed with 26 votes in favour, two against and seven abstentions, diplomats at the closed-door meeting told Reuters. Russia and China were the countries that voted against while Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Burundi, Vietnam, India and Pakistan abstained, the diplomats said. Both Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the plant, the largest in Europe, which could cause catastrophic damage to the region should anything happen. 6.25pm BST US imposes new sanctions on Russian individuals, entities The US has imposed new sanctions 22 Russian individuals and two Russian entities. The individuals include Maria Alexeyevna Lvova-Belova, Russias presidential commissioner for childrens rights, who has led Russias efforts to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and forced the adoption of Ukrainian children into Russian families. The entities include Task Force Rusich, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that has participated in combat alongside Russias military in Ukraine, even though the Kremlins main argument for the invasion of Ukraine was to denazify the country. 6.01pm BST Russian forces launched 33 rocket attacks on military and civilian targets in Ukraine today, damaging the infrastructure of more than 20 settlements in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Mykolayiv oblasts, the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces said in its daily briefing. The general staff said it believed that Russian forces were turning their focus to fully occupying the Donetsk oblast, holding captured territories and disrupting the activities of Ukrainian troops in other areas. There remains the threat of air and missile strikes throughout the territory of Ukraine, the general staff warned. Updated at 6.13pm BST 5.42pm BST A Ukrainian volunteer medic captured by Russian forces during their deadly siege of the port city of Mariupol delivered devastating testimony before US lawmakers on Thursday, recounting her experiences of torture, death and terror. Yuliia Paievska, who was detained in Mariupol in March and held by Russian and pro-Russia forces for three months, spoke before the Helsinki Commission, a government agency created in part to promote compliance with human rights internationally. Known by the nickname Taira, Paievska gained global attention after she slipped her bodycam footage to the Associated Press just before they left Mariupol. Her voice choked with emotion, she listed for the commission some of the atrocities she witnessed in Mariupol and in captivity: Pregnant prisoners, their fate unknown to their relatives or to the state. A fighter who was beaten for three hours and then thrown into a basement like a sack. And only a day later, someone came to him. A dead child in a mothers arm. A seven-year-old boy with bullet wounds dying in my lap because I could not ward off death in this case. Prisoners in their cells screaming for weeks and dying from the torture without any medical help during this internment of hell. The only thing they felt before death was abuse and additional beating. My friend, whose eyes I closed before his body closed down. And another friend. And another, and another. A city of a half a million people dying before my eyes, under air strikes, methodical, planned. Airstrikes on hospitals and residential areas. A hospital full of wounded soldiers and civilians where anaesthetic drugs have run out and antibiotics are about to run out too. Soldiers and entire medical staff sleeping two, three hours daily because surgeries are one right after another. Medivac cars arriving every five, 10 minutes where the wounded and the dead are lying on top of each other, and whose fates are too impossible to understand even if you tried. Burning cars with burning people in them. Police officers taking out of the rubble women and children mutilated beyond recognition. People collecting water from puddles. Looted homes. Dogs who once were pets dragging human limbs around the city. Prisoners who were forced to take off clothes by their killers before they were murdered slowly and slaughtered. Specially prepared torture chambers Do you know why we do this to you? Paievska said a Russian soldier asked her as he tortured her. Because you can, she responded. The accusations against the prisoners that are absolutely the same, where only the names change in the papers, and even the gender of the accused does not change. No one is trying to prove or investigate, evidence is obtained simply by using inhumane torture. #Taira #Ukraine-- Helsinki Commission (@HelsinkiComm) September 15, 2022 Updated at 6.15pm BST 5.06pm BST Russian troops launched missiles targeting infrastructure facilities in the Kirovohrad oblast in eastern Ukraine today, said Andrii Raikovych, governor of the region. The attack was reported around the Petrove village, Raikovych said. Air defence was able to shoot down one rocket. 4.47pm BST Von der Leyen: absolutely vital for EU member states to support Ukraine with military equipment In a quiet rebuke to Germany, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, addressed European Union member states who were not fulfilling their commitments to equip Ukraine. To all member states: its absolutely vital and necessary to support Ukraine with the military equipment they need to defend themselves. They have proven that they are able to do that if they are well equipped, she said. This is the general recommendation to all member states. When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shocked the world in announcing a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons. He committed to sending missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression - but six months later, many of those much-needed weapons have yet to arrive. In recent days, Ukraine upped its calls for more air defence and overall weapons deliveries, after a dramatically successful counter-offensive that has resulted in the recapturing of the Kharkiv region - but also retaliatory targeted attacks on the countrys infrastructure and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Updated at 4.52pm BST 4.33pm BST Von der Leyen: Ukraine has Europe by its side Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, ended her remarks in Kyiv by declaring that Ukraine has the European Union as a friend forever. We will never be able to match the sacrifice that the Ukrainians are giving when they lose their homes or they cry for their beloved ones that have gone. We will never be able to compensate what you do with your fight for democracy, for humanity, for the respect of the international rule of law, Von der Leyen said. But what we can tell you is that you have your European friends by your side as long as it takes, and we are friends forever. 4.21pm BST The European Union has earmarked EUR150m to aid internally displaced people in Ukraine get shelter through the winter, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said at Thursdays press conference in Kyiv. The EU has also set aside an additional EUR100m for reconstruction and repair work for schools that have been damaged in the invasion, with Von der Leyen noting that there are already 70 schools that immediately require work and 70,000 children who need schools to go back to. Its the children and the education where the future begins, she said. Updated at 4.52pm BST 4.15pm BST Von der Leyen: Ukraines ascension process to EU is well on track The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is in Kyiv for the third time since Russian forces invaded the country on 24 February - and since Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has begun more actively vying to join the European Union. In June, Ukraine was granted candidacy status and today, Von der Leyen said the countrys ascension process is well on track. Its impressive to see the speed, the determination, the preciseness to which you are progressing. We support you wherever we can, she said in a joint press conference with Zelenskiy. I cannot say to speed up the process because you are speeding it up. That is very good. Von der Leyen added that at the same time, we have agreed that we need to work as much as possible to make sure that Ukraine has more business, more income and that its as seamless access to the European single market as possible for Ukraine. Von der Leyen congratulated Zelenskiy on Ukraines recent military success in recapturing large swathes of territory in the Kharkiv region, and noted how impressive it was to see how life has come back to Kyiv since her last visit. 3.58pm BST The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is holding a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine has been vying to join the EU since the start of the Russian invasion, and was granted candidate status in June.

A 54-year-old man was injured in a mine explosion in the Kupiansk district, and there have been other cases of detonations of civilians, Oleh Syniehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, said on Telegram. I once again call on residents not to hurry back to the liberated territories until the demining is completed, Syniehubov said. Demining is a priority at the moment, and in particular, demining power lines, roads and life support facilities so that the state emergency service can quickly work to then restore electricity to the places without it, Syniehubov said. In the meantime, Russian troops continue to launch missiles into the city of Kharkiv and into populated areas of Kharkiv, Syniehubov said. There have been no casualties, but the shelling damaged five buildings in the city of Vovchansk. 3.08pm BST Two loud explosions have just been reported in the southern part of the Russian-occupied Melitopol, a city in the Zaporizhzhia oblast, Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. Fedorov did not elaborate on the explosions, but hinted at losses of the enemy. 2.38pm BST Reuters is reporting that Germany has given more details of its intention to supply further equipment to Ukraine. Defence minister Christine Lambrecht said in Berlin that her country will supply two more multiple rocket launchers to Kyiv. We have decided to deliver two more MARS II multiple rocket launchers including 200 rockets to Ukraine, she told a Bundeswehr conference, adding the training of the Ukrainian operators was expected to start in September. On top of this, we will send 50 Dingo armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine, Lambrecht announced, referring to a type of armoured vehicle. She also said a deal on a circle swap of infantry fighting vehicles with Greece and Ukraine was almost completed, meaning Germany would soon hand over 40 Marder IFVs to Greece while Greece, in turn, would pass on 40 of its Soviet-built BMP-1 IFVs to Ukraine. 2.23pm BST The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, where he is attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, and has met Chinas president, Xi Jinping.

Photograph: SPUTNIKReuters The Russian news agency Tass is carrying some quotes from the Russian president. In a pointed rebuke to the US, he told attenders: Attempts to create a unipolar world have recently taken on an absolutely ugly shape and are absolutely unacceptable for the vast majority of states on the planet. Tass quotes Xi saying that the world is facing colossal changes unprecedented in history and that Russia and the Peoples Republic of China would work together to set an example of a responsible world power and play a leading role in bringing such a rapidly changing world onto a path of sustainable and positive development. Putin said that trade turnover between China and Russia had increased by 35% last year. Updated at 2.28pm BST 2.01pm BST Today so far The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is in Kyiv this morning to meet with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Ukraines prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Zelenskiy, in his first in-person appearance after getting in a minor car crash yesterday, presented Von der Leyen with the award of the First Class of the Order of Yaroslav the Wise. Another Russian missile has hit Kryvyi Rih, just barely half a day after eight Russian missiles took out hydraulic structures along the Inhulets River, causing extensive flooding. Todays missile strike hit an industrial site and the destruction is serious, said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraines foreign minister, called the attack on the Kryvyi Rih hydraulic structures a war crime and an act of terror. Beaten by Ukrainian army on the battlefield, Russian cowards are now at war with our critical infrastructure and civilians, Kuleba said. Russia is a terrorist state and must be recognised as such. Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Russian gas exports to the European Union would decline by 50bn cubic metres this year - a third of last years total Russian gas exports to the EU, Interfax news agency is reporting. Last year, Russia exported about 150bn cubic metres in gas to the EU. Should the US decide to supply Kyiv with longer-range missiles, that would cross a red line and the US would then become a party to the conflict, Russias foreign ministry said Thursday. Ukraine is already using US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems - just not US-made longer-range missiles. Ukraines state border guard service rescued five teenagers who had been locked in a basement for seven days by Russian troops in the recently liberated city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region. The teenagers, four girls and a boy aged 15 to 17, are all students of the same educational institute. They said Russian soldiers had locked them in the basement without an explanation. They are safe now, the state border guard service said on Telegram. 2.00pm BST Governor: Russians are digging in in Luhansk oblast The Russian-occupied Luhansk oblast unfortunately should not expect a swift liberation as seen in the Kharkiv oblast, Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk oblast, said on Thursday. They are preparing to defend themselves: the Russians are digging in at Svatovo and Troitske, Haidai wrote on Telegram, referencing two settlements in his oblast. Heavy fighting continues in many directions, including in Luhansk region. The Kharkiv instant scenario will not be repeated. Haidai said Russian troops were now gathering men in prisons. We will have to fight hard for our region, Haidai said. The Russians are preparing for defence. Updated at 2.01pm BST 1.47pm BST Volodymyr Zelenskiys home city, Kryvyi Rih, is experiencing excessive flooding after eight Russian missiles struck hydraulic structures along the Inhulets river in a targeted attack that aligns with Ukraines concerns that Russia will continue to target Ukraines infrastructure in retribution for its success in regaining occupied territory. Footage shared on Telegram and social media shows streets and downstream settlements flooded after the Inhulets river broke its banks. In his nightly video address, the Ukrainian president said, Everything is being done to eliminate the consequences of yet another vile Russian act. 1.23pm BST Russia: US supplying Kyiv with longer-range missiles would cross a red line Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russias foreign ministry, said on Thursday that if the US decided to supply Kyiv with longer-range missiles, that would cross a red line and the US would then become a party to the conflict, Reuters is reporting. Ukraine is already using US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems - just not US-made longer-range missiles. Maria Zakharova added that Russia reserves the right to defend its territory. Updated at 1.26pm BST 1.05pm BST Izium was one of at least 388 settlements liberated by the Ukrainian military in the Kharkiv region since 6 September. Many of the about 150,000 people living here had been under Russian occupation since almost the very start of the invasion - half a year. Guardian correspondents Isabel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo were there yesterday to speak to the residents and understand what those six months were like for them: 1Yesterday, people were allowed to visit Izium, in Kharkiv region, for the first time since it was occupied by Russia in early March.

Russia exported about 150bn cubic metres in gas to the EU last year, according to Reuters. Russian energy supplies to Europe have significantly declined this year amid a stand-off and sweeping western sanctions against Russia following Moscows invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Before the invasion, Russia supplied about 40% of the EUs gas. That share has now plummeted to 9%, with Moscow cutting supplies to Europe and blaming western sanctions for the dip.

This is Zelenskiys first major in-person appearance after getting in a minor car crash yesterday - a car collided with the presidents cars and escort cars in Kyiv. He was not seriously hurt and appears in good health. Updated at 12.17pm BST 11.05am BST Summary of the day so far ... The major city of Kryvyi Rih struggled to contain damage to its water system from Russian missile attacks. The largest city in central Ukraine, with an estimated pre-war population of 650,000, was targeted by eight cruise missiles on Wednesday, officials said. The missile strikes hit the Karachunov reservoir dam. The water pumping station was destroyed. The river broke through the dam and overflowed its banks. Residential buildings are just a few meters away from the river, Ukrainian legislator Inna Sovsun said. Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the Krivyi Rih military administration, said in a post on Telegram that 112 homes were flooded but that works to repair the dam on the Inhulets river were under way, and that flooding was receding. He added that water levels had dropped considerably and that there were no casualties. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was involved in a traffic accident in Kyiv last night, but he is not seriously hurt, his spokesperson said in a Facebook post early on Thursday. Serhii Nykyforov, who did not say when the accident occurred, said Zelenskiys car had collided with a private vehicle. The president was examined by a doctor, no serious injuries were found, he said, adding the accident would be investigated. Medics accompanying Zelenskiy gave the driver of the private car emergency aid and put him in an ambulance, he said. In his nightly televised address, video of which was posted shortly after the accident, Zelenskiy said he had just returned from the area around Kharkiv, adding that almost the entire region is de-occupied after a lightning counteroffensive to dislodge Russian troops. It was an unprecedented movement of our soldiers - the Ukrainians once again managed to do what many thought was impossible, he said. After visiting the liberated city of Izium, Zelenskiy said Ukraines troops had recaptured around 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) of territory. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, has claimed that about 120 Ukrainian soldiers were killed while trying to enter Kherson region in the south of Ukraine via the Kinburn Spit. Rail services will resume between Kharkiv and Balakliia in Kharkiv oblast on Thursday. Workers have already repaired bridges and dozens of damaged tracks after Balakliia was liberated on 8 September. Ukraine has continued to consolidate control of the newly liberated Kharkiv region, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest briefing. The update said some Russian forces appeared to have fled the Ukrainian troops advance in apparent panic, leaving behind key equipment. Ukraines defence ministry found what its officials believe to be a torture chamber used by Russian troops to hold Ukrainian prisoners in the city of Balakliia. While some Balakliia residents told the Guardian that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostly stayed on edges of the town, and did not experience the scenes of torture and execution seen elsewhere in the country, Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv region national police investigation department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. One resident told the BBC that he was held by Russians in the citys police station for more than 40 days and was tortured with electrocution. Russian president Vladimir Putin, has arrived in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, where he is later expected to meet Chinas Xi Jinping. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Kyiv Thursday morning. She has tweeted that she will be meeting Zelenskiy and Ukraines prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. On Wednesday, addressing the European parliament in Strasbourg, Von der Leyen insisted Putin will fail and Europe will prevail and said that the EU would stay the course with its sanctions on Russia. The sanctions are here to stay, she said. This is the time for us to show resolve not appeasement. Germanys economy minister, Robert Habeck, said on Thursday that according to Kyivs own estimates, Ukraine needs EUR350bn (PS300bn  $350bn) for reconstruction. The prospects for peace in Ukraine are currently minimal, the UN secretary general said on Wednesday after a phone conversation with Putin. I have the feeling we are still far away from peace. I would be lying if I would say it could happen soon, Guterres said, adding: I have no illusion; at the present moment the chances of a peace deal are minimal. Even a ceasefire was not in sight, he said. Kremlin sources are now working to clear Putin of any responsibly of the defeat, instead blaming the loss of almost all of occupied Kharkiv oblast on under-informed military advisers, according to the US-based thinktank Institute of the Study of War. In a statement reported by CNBC, the institute said that Kremlin officials and state media propagandists are extensively discussing the reasons for the Russian defeat in Kharkiv oblast, a marked change from their previous pattern of reporting on exaggerated or fabricated Russian successes with limited detail. Putin still believes he was right to launch an invasion of Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Wednesday after a 90-minute telephone call with the Russian president. Sadly, I cannot tell you that the impression has grown that it was a mistake to begin this war, Scholz said in a press briefing. Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft guns and 65 refrigerators to Ukraine, the German government announced on Wednesday. The four additional units bring the total number of Gepard units provided by Germany to Ukraine to 24. Updated at 11.27am BST 10.33am BST Russias RIA Novosti news agency is carrying quotes from Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine.

Now they flee Ukraine 5.32am BST Kryvyi Rih flood threat after missiles hit water system The major city of Kryvyi Rih is struggling to contain damage to its water system from Russian missile attacks. The largest city in central Ukraine, with an estimated pre-war population of 650,000, was targeted by eight cruise missiles on Wednesday, officials said. A report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said footage of the aftermath of the attack showed a 2.5 metre rise in the level of the Inhulets River in Kryvyi Rih. The water pumping station was destroyed. The river broke through the dam and overflowed its banks. Residential buildings are just a few meters away from the river, Ukrainian legislator Inna Sovsun said on Twitter. The missile strikes hit the Karachunov reservoir dam, Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address released early on Thursday. The water system had no military value and hundreds of thousands of civilians depend on it daily, he said. The ISW report said the attacks may have been intended to damage Ukrainian pontoon bridges further downstream as part of efforts to disrupt the Kherson counteroffensive, it said. Damage to the hydraulic structure in Kryvyi Rih. Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press ServiceReuters Updated at 6.06am BST 5.30am BST Summary and welcome Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. At 7.30am in Kyiv, these are the latest developments. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was involved in a traffic accident in Kyiv, but he is not seriously hurt, his spokesperson said in a Facebook post early on Thursday. Serhii Nykyforov, who did not say when the accident occurred, said Zelenskiys car had collided with a private vehicle. The president was examined by a doctor, no serious injuries were found, he said, adding the accident would be investigated. Medics accompanying Zelenskiy gave the driver of the private car emergency aid and put him in an ambulance, he said. Eight Russian missiles that struck Kryvyi Rih on Wednesday were directed at hydraulic structures, causing enough damage that the water level of the Inhulets RInhulets riveriver was rising and posing a serious threat to the city. This aligns with Ukraines concerns that Russia will continue to target Ukraines infrastructure in retribution for its success in regaining occupied territory. Kryvyi Rih is Zelenskiys home town. In his nightly televised address, video of which was posted shortly after the accident, Zelenskiy said he had just returned from the area around Kharkiv, adding that almost the entire region is de-occupied after a lightning counteroffensive to dislodge Russian troops. It was an unprecedented movement of our soldiers - the Ukrainians once again managed to do what many thought was impossible, he said. After visiting the liberated city of Izium, Zelenskiy said Ukraines troops had recaptured around 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) of territory. Ukraines defence ministry found what its officials believe to be a torture chamber used by Russian troops to hold Ukrainian prisoners in the city of Balakliia. While some Balakliia residents told the Guardian that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostly stayed on edges of the town, and did not experience the scenes of torture and execution seen elsewhere in the country, Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv region national police investigation department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. One resident told the BBC that he was held by Russians in the citys police station for more than 40 days and was tortured with electrocution. Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft guns and 65 refrigerators to Ukraine, the German government announced on Wednesday. The four additional units bring the total number of Gepard units provided by Germany to Ukraine to 24. Kremlin sources are now working to clear [Russias President Vladimir] Putin of any responsibly of the defeat, instead blaming the loss of almost all of occupied Kharkiv oblast on under-informed military advisers, according to the Institute of the Study of War. In a statement reported by CNBC, the institute said that Kremlin officials and state media propagandists are extensively discussing the reasons for the Russian defeat in Kharkiv oblast, a marked change from their previous pattern of reporting on exaggerated or fabricated Russian successes with limited detail. The prospects for peace in Ukraine are currently minimal, the UN secretary general said on Wednesday after a phone conversation with Vladimir Putin. I have the feeling we are still far away from peace. I would be lying if I would say it could happen soon, Guterres said, adding: I have no illusion; at the present moment the chances of a peace deal are minimal. Even a ceasefire was not in sight, he said. Putin still believes he was right to launch an invasion of Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Wednesday after a 90-minute telephone call with the Russian president. Sadly, I cannot tell you that the impression has grown that it was a mistake to begin this war, Scholz said in a press briefing. Russian troops have returned to Kreminna, a city in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region that was completely empty yesterday, said Serhiy Hadai, the regions governor, and tore down the Ukrainian flags that local partisans had raised in celebration. Yesterday, a similar situation happened in Svatove - Russian troops left but returned after some time, Hadai said. Russian troops also left Starobilsk, another city in the Luhansk region.

And like many parents, thats also meant working from home with my children hovering over my shoulder, asking for their next snack or chance to leave the house. Its an impossible juggle, made worse by wet weather last week keeping us indoors. According to survey results from the Australian Institute of Family Studies, 67% of Australian parents work from home (up 25% since Australias lockdowns began in 2020), but their experiences are far from seamless, with 49% saying they find it difficult to combine work and care responsibilities, and 40% saying they were always or often actively caring for children while working. So how does one manage? Rachel Tomlinson, registered psychologist and author of Teaching Kids to be Kind, suggests trying to keep your children as close as possible to their usual routines - even packing their lunch boxes - to protect their sense of consistency and safety. Set up activities that involve delayed gratification or some future goal, like ... planting some herbs, or an art project Rachel Tomlinson The random nature of lockdown and the lack of preparation or awareness that often comes with it - coupled with the confusion around Covid-19 itself - makes for an emotional time for children, who dont cope well with change at the best of times. Setting clear expectations, routines and boundaries can also help children adjust around your work schedule. Having clear signals or symbols that represent time or situations where parents cant be interrupted, like a sign on the office door, or headphones on, is really important, she says. If we involve them in the planning of the day, or negotiations around how boundaries are set, they are more likely to respect the rules ... because they were involved in the process. She also advises carving out time to be truly present with your children, looking them in the eye, sitting close and engaging in quality interactions without the distractions of work or phones. Related: Happy hookers: how prescribing creativity might help wellbeing Then, when you do need to work, she suggests choosing tasks for children that offer a sustained involvement. Having a tick box or activity list can work really well to keep kids occupied long enough for you to tackle your to-do list. Set up activities that involve delayed gratification or some future goal, like ... planting some herbs, or an art project, she says. Balance out their activities and plan something to meet [their] different needs - physical, emotional, social. Dont keep virtual meetings to yourself either, Tomlinson advises. Put your kids to task on online courses, video demonstrations, or even games and quiz sessions with friends and family online. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning This was Andrea Christie-Davids exact thought when she extended the services of Leor - the in-home, early childhood education and disability support service she founded in 2018 - to families stuck at home during the lockdowns of 2020. She knew there was a demand for a fun and engaging interactive learning program that could free parents up for an hour each day. She is holding free online playgroups for families at 11am AEST every weekday until 9 July. Families can book into the online playgroups through Leors Facebook page, and can expect their children to do things such as yoga, craft, show and tell, and treasure hunts with items in the home that they can then show other children in the group. We have been overwhelmed by just how engaged children have been ... they have focused on the yoga and completed craft activities with other children online, she says. Resilience educator Fiona Perrella suggests getting your kids to create a boredom buster jar filled with activities they decided on themselves. Photograph: Sonja RachbauerGetty ImagesiStockphoto If youre reading this and wondering about your own childs ability focus, dont fret, because resilience educator and mum Fiona Perrella says that boredom can actually be healthy for your children too. Every time you find something for them to do, you are teaching them that their entertainment is dependent on other people, she says. Lockdown is an opportunity to let your kids develop the ability to entertain themselves. Perrella founded Strength Heroes, which creates art and play-based experiences for children, in 2012. She offers activity ideas on Facebook and Instagram, as well as a free downloadable kit of activities on the Strength Heroes website. Like Tomlinson, she says creating a day plan with your children with blocks of time for different purposes, and sticking to it, can be an effective way to safeguard work time. It puts the onus on them to address their own boredom. Fiona Perrella recommends asking children to do activities that will keep them social - like interviewing their grandparents about what their lives were like as children. Photograph: Pollyana VenturaGetty Images While you work, children can choose activities from a boredom-buster chart or jar, containing tasks they themselves have put together. Stuck for ideas? Turn to social media, where listicles of ideas by parents abound. Sydney mum Daniela Minns list of screen-free activities has reportedly gone viral. While some tasks require parental supervision, others can be tweaked for the working parent by setting them as a challenge. Perrella also has a pro-social approach to her strategies, like writing cards or drawing pictures for people in local nursing homes, chats with grandparents about their childhood over Facetime, and writing missing you cards to friends. Tomlinson says that parents need to be kind to themselves too - practical about their own output, accepting of fluctuations in their energy levels, and adamant about normalising their feelings and engaging in self-care. Its important to be realistic, she says. Most parents dont have degrees in teaching or child education, [and dont have] additional hours in the day to cope with extra duties.","SOURCE":"The Guardian"}]
